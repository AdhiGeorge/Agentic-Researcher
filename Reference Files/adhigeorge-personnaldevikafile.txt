# Output:
#   Yes, many Azure services support **customer-managed keys (CMK)**, allowing you to bring your own encryption keys for added control and security over your data. These keys are typically stored in **Azure Key Vault**, a secure cloud repository for secrets, keys, and certificates. Below are examples of Azure services that support customer-managed keys:

#   

#   ### 1. **Azure Storage (Blob, File, Table, and Queue)**

#      - Supports CMK for encrypting data at rest using Azure Key Vault.

#      - Provides enhanced security where you can rotate keys or revoke them at any time.

#   

#   ### 2. **Azure SQL Database**

#      - Supports **Always Encrypted** feature with customer-managed keys to encrypt sensitive data.

#      - Integration with Azure Key Vault for managing column-level encryption keys.

#   

#   ### 3. **Azure Cosmos DB**

#      - Offers the ability to use customer-managed keys for data encryption at rest to ensure greater data security.

#   

#   ### 4. **Azure Virtual Machines (Disk Encryption)**

#      - Can use customer-managed keys to encrypt disks attached to Virtual Machines with **Azure Disk Encryption** or **Server-Side Encryption**.

#   

#   ### 5. **Azure Synapse Analytics**

#      - Supports CMK for encrypting data with customer-defined encryption keys stored in Azure Key Vault.

#   

#   ### 6. **Azure Data Lake Storage**

#      - Data encryption at rest with customer-managed keys via integration with Azure Key Vault.

#   

#   ### 7. **Azure Managed Disks**

#      - Supports encryption-at-rest with customer-managed keys stored in Azure Key Vault.

#   

#   ### 8. **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**

#      - Encrypts data in **etcd** (the AKS-managed cluster metadata store) using customer-managed keys from Azure Key Vault.

#   

#   ### 9. **Azure Cognitive Services**

#      - Certain Cognitive Services allow for encryption of data at rest using customer-managed keys (e.g., Azure Form Recognizer).

#   

#   ### 10. **Azure Backup**

#      - Allows using customer-managed keys to encrypt backed-up data.

#   

#   ### 11. **Azure Key Vault itself**

#      - Though it's the central repository for managing CMK, Key Vault's secrets and keys can also be encrypted using customer-managed keys.

#   

#   ### 12. **Azure Purview**

#      - Supports customer-managed keys for encrypting sensitive data.

#   

#   ### 13. **Azure Kubernetes Security Features**

#      - CMKs can be used to encrypt secrets for containers and applications.

#   

#   ### 14. **Azure Machine Learning**

#      - Offers encryption for workspace resources and artifacts with customer-managed keys.

#   

#   ### Benefits of Customer-Managed Keys:

#   - **Control:** You can revoke or rotate keys whenever needed.

#   - **Compliance:** Helps meet regulatory requirements and industry standards.

#   - **Security:** Ensures encryption keys are fully managed by you, providing a higher degree of data protection.

#   

#   Azure's support for customer-managed keys is extensive across its services, enabling a unified strategy for data security. Always refer to the specific service's documentation to confirm its CMK capabilities and implementation details.

# Swarm (experimental, educational)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Swarm is now replaced by the [OpenAI Agents SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python), which is a production-ready evolution of Swarm. The Agents SDK features key improvements and will be actively maintained by the OpenAI team.
>
> We recommend migrating to the Agents SDK for all production use cases.

## Install

Requires Python 3.10+

```shell
pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/openai/swarm.git
```

or

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/swarm.git
```

## Usage

```python
from swarm import Swarm, Agent

client = Swarm()

def transfer_to_agent_b():
    return agent_b


agent_a = Agent(
    name="Agent A",
    instructions="You are a helpful agent.",

# Overview

Swarm focuses on making agent **coordination** and **execution** lightweight, highly controllable, and easily testable.

It accomplishes this through two primitive abstractions: `Agent`s and **handoffs**. An `Agent` encompasses `instructions` and `tools`, and can at any point choose to hand off a conversation to another `Agent`.

These primitives are powerful enough to express rich dynamics between tools and networks of agents, allowing you to build scalable, real-world solutions while avoiding a steep learning curve.

> [!NOTE]
> Swarm Agents are not related to Assistants in the Assistants API. They are named similarly for convenience, but are otherwise completely unrelated. Swarm is entirely powered by the Chat Completions API and is hence stateless between calls.

## Why Swarm

Swarm explores patterns that are lightweight, scalable, and highly customizable by design. Approaches similar to Swarm are best suited for situations dealing with a large number of independent capabilities and instructions that are difficult to encode into a single prompt.

The Assistants API is a great option for developers looking for fully-hosted threads and built in memory management and retrieval. However, Swarm is an educational resource for developers curious to learn about multi-agent orchestration. Swarm runs (almost) entirely on the client and, much like the Chat Completions API, does not store state between calls.

## Running Swarm

Start by instantiating a Swarm client (which internally just instantiates an `OpenAI` client).

```python
from swarm import Swarm

client = Swarm()
```

### `client.run()`

Swarm's `run()` function is analogous to the `chat.completions.create()` function in the Chat Completions API – it takes `messages` and returns `messages` and saves no state between calls. Importantly, however, it also handles Agent function execution, hand-offs, context variable references, and can take multiple turns before returning to the user.

At its core, Swarm's `client.run()` implements the following loop:

1. Get a completion from the current Agent
2. Execute tool calls and append results
3. Switch Agent if necessary
4. Update context variables, if necessary
5. If no new function calls, return

#### Arguments

| Argument              | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                            | Default        |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| **agent**             | `Agent` | The (initial) agent to be called.                                                                                                                      | (required)     |
| **messages**          | `List`  | A list of message objects, identical to [Chat Completions `messages`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-messages) | (required)     |
| **context_variables** | `dict`  | A dictionary of additional context variables, available to functions and Agent instructions                                                            | `{}`           |
| **max_turns**         | `int`   | The maximum number of conversational turns allowed                                                                                                     | `float("inf")` |
| **model_override**    | `str`   | An optional string to override the model being used by an Agent                                                                                        | `None`         |
| **execute_tools**     | `bool`  | If `False`, interrupt execution and immediately returns `tool_calls` message when an Agent tries to call a function                                    | `True`         |
| **stream**            | `bool`  | If `True`, enables streaming responses                                                                                                                 | `False`        |
| **debug**             | `bool`  | If `True`, enables debug logging                                                                                                                       | `False`        |

Once `client.run()` is finished (after potentially multiple calls to agents and tools) it will return a `Response` containing all the relevant updated state. Specifically, the new `messages`, the last `Agent` to be called, and the most up-to-date `context_variables`. You can pass these values (plus new user messages) in to your next execution of `client.run()` to continue the interaction where it left off – much like `chat.completions.create()`. (The `run_demo_loop` function implements an example of a full execution loop in `/swarm/repl/repl.py`.)

#### `Response` Fields

| Field                 | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **messages**          | `List`  | A list of message objects generated during the conversation. Very similar to [Chat Completions `messages`](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat-create-messages), but with a `sender` field indicating which `Agent` the message originated from. |
| **agent**             | `Agent` | The last agent to handle a message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **context_variables** | `dict`  | The same as the input variables, plus any changes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Agents

An `Agent` simply encapsulates a set of `instructions` with a set of `functions` (plus some additional settings below), and has the capability to hand off execution to another `Agent`.

While it's tempting to personify an `Agent` as "someone who does X", it can also be used to represent a very specific workflow or step defined by a set of `instructions` and `functions` (e.g. a set of steps, a complex retrieval, single step of data transformation, etc). This allows `Agent`s to be composed into a network of "agents", "workflows", and "tasks", all represented by the same primitive.

## `Agent` Fields

| Field            | Type                     | Description                                                                   | Default                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **name**         | `str`                    | The name of the agent.                                                        | `"Agent"`                    |
| **model**        | `str`                    | The model to be used by the agent.                                            | `"gpt-4o"`                   |
| **instructions** | `str` or `func() -> str` | Instructions for the agent, can be a string or a callable returning a string. | `"You are a helpful agent."` |
| **functions**    | `List`                   | A list of functions that the agent can call.                                  | `[]`                         |
| **tool_choice**  | `str`                    | The tool choice for the agent, if any.                                        | `None`                       |

### Instructions

`Agent` `instructions` are directly converted into the `system` prompt of a conversation (as the first message). Only the `instructions` of the active `Agent` will be present at any given time (e.g. if there is an `Agent` handoff, the `system` prompt will change, but the chat history will not.)

```python
agent = Agent(
   instructions="You are a helpful agent."
)
```

The `instructions` can either be a regular `str`, or a function that returns a `str`. The function can optionally receive a `context_variables` parameter, which will be populated by the `context_variables` passed into `client.run()`.

```python
def instructions(context_variables):
   user_name = context_variables["user_name"]
   return f"Help the user, {user_name}, do whatever they want."

agent = Agent(
   instructions=instructions
)
response = client.run(
   agent=agent,
   messages=[{"role":"user", "content": "Hi!"}],
   context_variables={"user_name":"John"}
)
print(response.messages[-1]["content"])
```

```
Hi John, how can I assist you today?
```

## Functions

- Swarm `Agent`s can call python functions directly.
- Function should usually return a `str` (values will be attempted to be cast as a `str`).
- If a function returns an `Agent`, execution will be transferred to that `Agent`.
- If a function defines a `context_variables` parameter, it will be populated by the `context_variables` passed into `client.run()`.

```python
def greet(context_variables, language):
   user_name = context_variables["user_name"]
   greeting = "Hola" if language.lower() == "spanish" else "Hello"
   print(f"{greeting}, {user_name}!")
   return "Done"

agent = Agent(
   functions=[greet]
)

client.run(
   agent=agent,
   messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Usa greet() por favor."}],
   context_variables={"user_name": "John"}
)
```

```
Hola, John!
```

- If an `Agent` function call has an error (missing function, wrong argument, error) an error response will be appended to the chat so the `Agent` can recover gracefully.
- If multiple functions are called by the `Agent`, they will be executed in that order.

### Handoffs and Updating Context Variables

An `Agent` can hand off to another `Agent` by returning it in a `function`.

```python
sales_agent = Agent(name="Sales Agent")

def transfer_to_sales():
   return sales_agent

agent = Agent(functions=[transfer_to_sales])

response = client.run(agent, [{"role":"user", "content":"Transfer me to sales."}])
print(response.agent.name)
```

```
Sales Agent
```

It can also update the `context_variables` by returning a more complete `Result` object. This can also contain a `value` and an `agent`, in case you want a single function to return a value, update the agent, and update the context variables (or any subset of the three).

```python
sales_agent = Agent(name="Sales Agent")

def talk_to_sales():
   print("Hello, World!")
   return Result(
       value="Done",
       agent=sales_agent,
       context_variables={"department": "sales"}
   )

agent = Agent(functions=[talk_to_sales])

response = client.run(
   agent=agent,
   messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Transfer me to sales"}],
   context_variables={"user_name": "John"}
)
print(response.agent.name)
print(response.context_variables)
```

```
Sales Agent
{'department': 'sales', 'user_name': 'John'}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If an `Agent` calls multiple functions to hand-off to an `Agent`, only the last handoff function will be used.

### Function Schemas

Swarm automatically converts functions into a JSON Schema that is passed into Chat Completions `tools`.

- Docstrings are turned into the function `description`.
- Parameters without default values are set to `required`.
- Type hints are mapped to the parameter's `type` (and default to `string`).
- Per-parameter descriptions are not explicitly supported, but should work similarly if just added in the docstring. (In the future docstring argument parsing may be added.)

```python
def greet(name, age: int, location: str = "New York"):
   """Greets the user. Make sure to get their name and age before calling.

   Args:
      name: Name of the user.
      age: Age of the user.
      location: Best place on earth.
   """
   print(f"Hello {name}, glad you are {age} in {location}!")
```

```javascript
{
   "type": "function",
   "function": {
      "name": "greet",
      "description": "Greets the user. Make sure to get their name and age before calling.\n\nArgs:\n   name: Name of the user.\n   age: Age of the user.\n   location: Best place on earth.",
      "parameters": {
         "type": "object",
         "properties": {
            "name": {"type": "string"},
            "age": {"type": "integer"},
            "location": {"type": "string"}
         },
         "required": ["name", "age"]
      }
   }
}
```

## Streaming

```python
stream = client.run(agent, messages, stream=True)
for chunk in stream:
   print(chunk)
```

Uses the same events as [Chat Completions API streaming](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming). See `process_and_print_streaming_response` in `/swarm/repl/repl.py` as an example.

Two new event types have been added:

- `{"delim":"start"}` and `{"delim":"end"}`, to signal each time an `Agent` handles a single message (response or function call). This helps identify switches between `Agent`s.
- `{"response": Response}` will return a `Response` object at the end of a stream with the aggregated (complete) response, for convenience.

# Evaluations

Evaluations are crucial to any project, and we encourage developers to bring their own eval suites to test the performance of their swarms. For reference, we have some examples for how to eval swarm in the `airline`, `weather_agent` and `triage_agent` quickstart examples. See the READMEs for more details.

# Utils

Use the `run_demo_loop` to test out your swarm! This will run a REPL on your command line. Supports streaming.

```python
from swarm.repl import run_demo_loop
...
run_demo_loop(agent, stream=True)
```

# Airline customer service

This example demonstrates a multi-agent setup for handling different customer service requests in an airline context using the Swarm framework. The agents can triage requests, handle flight modifications, cancellations, and lost baggage cases.
This example uses the helper function `run_demo_loop`, which allows us to create an interactive Swarm session.

## Agents

1. **Triage Agent**: Determines the type of request and transfers to the appropriate agent.
2. **Flight Modification Agent**: Handles requests related to flight modifications, further triaging them into:
   - **Flight Cancel Agent**: Manages flight cancellation requests.
   - **Flight Change Agent**: Manages flight change requests.
3. **Lost Baggage Agent**: Handles lost baggage inquiries.

## Setup

Once you have installed dependencies and Swarm, run the example using:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

## Evaluations

> [!NOTE]
> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.

For this example, we run function evals, where we input a conversation, and the expected function call ('None' if no function call is expected).
The evaluation cases are stored in `eval/eval_cases/` subfolder.

```json
[
  {
    "conversation": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "My bag was not delivered!" }
    ],
    "function": "transfer_to_lost_baggage"
  },
  {
    "conversation": [
      { "role": "user", "content": "I had some turbulence on my flight" }
    ],
    "function": "None"
  }
]
```

The script 'function_evals.py' will run the evals. Make sure to set `n` to the number
of times you want to run each particular eval. To run the script from the root airline folder, execute:

```bash
cd evals
python3 function_evals.py
```

The results of these evaluations will be stored in `evals/eval_results/`

# Swarm basic

This folder contains basic examples demonstrating core Swarm capabilities. These examples show the simplest implementations of Swarm, with one input message, and a corresponding output. The `simple_loop_no_helpers` has a while loop to demonstrate how to create an interactive Swarm session.

### Examples

1. **agent_handoff.py**

   - Demonstrates how to transfer a conversation from one agent to another.
   - **Usage**: Transfers Spanish-speaking users from an English agent to a Spanish agent.

2. **bare_minimum.py**

   - A bare minimum example showing the basic setup of an agent.
   - **Usage**: Sets up an agent that responds to a simple user message.

3. **context_variables.py**

   - Shows how to use context variables within an agent.
   - **Usage**: Uses context variables to greet a user by name and print account details.

4. **function_calling.py**

   - Demonstrates how to define and call functions from an agent.
   - **Usage**: Sets up an agent that can respond with weather information for a given location.

5. **simple_loop_no_helpers.py**
   - An example of a simple interaction loop without using helper functions.
   - **Usage**: Sets up a loop where the user can continuously interact with the agent, printing the conversation.

## Running the Examples

To run any of the examples, use the following command:

```shell
python3 <example_name>.py
```

You are a planner for the Swarm framework.
Your job is to create a properly formatted JSON plan step by step, to satisfy the task given.
Create a list of subtasks based off the [TASK] provided. Your FIRST THOUGHT should be, do I need to call a tool here to answer
or fulfill the user's request. First, think through the steps of the plan necessary. Make sure to carefully look over the tools you are given access to to decide this.
If you are confident that you do not need a tool to respond, either just in conversation or to ask for clarification or more information, respond to the prompt in a concise, but conversational, tone in double quotes. Do not explain that you do not need a tool.
If you DO need tools, create a list of subtasks. Each subtask must be from within the [AVAILABLE TOOLS] list. DO NOT use any tools that are not in the list.
Make sure you have all information needed to call the tools you use in your plan.
Base your decisions on which tools to use from the description and the name and arguments of the tool.
Always output the arguments of the tool, even when arguments is an empty dictionary. MAKE SURE YOU USE ALL REQUIRED ARGUMENTS.
The plan should be as short as possible.

{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\n\n\u200bSince releasing the Answers endpoint in beta last year, we\u2019ve developed new methods that achieve better results for this task. As a result, we\u2019ll be removing the Answers endpoint from our documentation and removing access to this endpoint on December 3, 2022 for all organizations. New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/answers> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/answers>\n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Answers endpoint:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524217540/51eda23e171f33f1b9d5acff/rM6ZVI3XZ2CpxcEStmG5mFy6ATBCskmX2g3_GPmeY3FicvrWfJCuFOtzsnbkpMQe-TQ6hi5j1BV9cFo7bCDcsz8VWxFfeOnC1Gb4QNaeVYtJq4Qtg76SBOLLk-jgHUA8mWZ0QgOuV636UgcvMA)All of these options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints)\n\n\n\nOption 1: Transition to Embeddings-based search (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving the underlying search system to use a vector-based embedding search. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our embeddings system has much more contextual awareness. Also, in general, using embeddings will be considerably lower cost in the long run. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using a small dataset (<10,000 documents), consider using the techniques described in that guide to find the best documents to construct a prompt similar to [this](#h_89196129b2). Then, you can just submit that prompt to our [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset, consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/beyond_search_openai/src/server.py) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to recreate the functionality of the Answers endpoint, here\u2019s how we did it. There is also a [script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/answers_functionality_example.py) that replicates most of this functionality.\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are two main ways you can use the answers endpoint: you can source the data from an uploaded file or send it in with the request.\n\n\n\n**If you\u2019re using the document parameter**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one step if you provide the documents in the Answers API call.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used: \n\n\n* Construct the prompt [with this format.](#h_89196129b2)\n* Gather all of the provided documents. If they fit in the prompt, just use all of them.\n* Do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) (note that this is also being deprecated and has a [transition guide](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/dgkjq2bp/articles/articles/6272952/show)) where the documents are the user provided documents and the query is the query from above. Rank the documents by score.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the context.\n* Request a completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc)\n\n\nThroughout all of this, you\u2019ll need to check that the prompt\u2019s length doesn\u2019t exceed [the model's token limit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/gpt-3). To assess the number of tokens present in a prompt, we recommend <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast>. \n\n\n\nIf you're using the file parameter\n----------------------------------\n\n\nStep 1: upload a jsonl file\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, we upload new files meant for answers to an Elastic search cluster. Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nIf you uploaded the file with the purpose \u201canswers,\u201d we additionally split the documents on newlines and upload each of those chunks as separate documents to ensure that we can search across and reference the highest number of relevant text sections in the file.\n\n\n\nEach line requires a \u201ctext\u201d field and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field.\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_rerank` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used. Our end goal is to create a [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) request [with this format](#h_89196129b2). It will look very similar to [Documents](#h_cb1d8a8d3f)\n\n\n\nFrom there, our steps are: \n\n\n* Start with the `experimental\\_alternative\\_question` or, if that's not provided, what\u2019s in the `question` field. Call that the query.\n* Query Elastic search for `max\\_rerank` documents with query as the search param.\n* Take those documents and do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) on them where the entries from Elastic search are the docs, and the query is the query that you used above. Use the score from the search to rank the documents.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the prompt.\n* Request an OpenAI completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc). Return that answer to the user.\n\n\nCompletion Prompt\n-----------------\n\n\n\n```\n===  \nContext: #{{ provided examples_context }}  \n===  \nQ: example 1 question  \nA: example 1 answer  \n---  \nQ: example 2 question  \nA: example 2 answer  \n(and so on for all examples provided in the request)   \n===  \nContext: #{{ what we return from Elasticsearch }}  \n===  \nQ: #{{ user provided question }}   \nA:\n```\n", "title": "Answers Transition Guide", "article_id": "6233728", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6233728-answers-transition-guide"}

New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/classifications> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/classifications> \n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nAll of these options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints).\n\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Classifications endpoint:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524219891/aa3136e9c7bcd8697c51ae9a/wDEz1wePRC3E7UyA1n0lsTPUvVakpPlMQ92SDnvEsScQFclIRW-bO2eKRhAp9_15j0vnyPYnhG71PjJj6Fttfwdpb1UnHZzMle9llSC76HQHN9lCzMNF6N2UDmeWzOldgwqRYYy-hzxBAD61Nw)\nOption 1: Transition to fine-tuning (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving to a fine tuned model. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our fine tuned system can take in an arbitrary amount of data and learn more nuance between examples. For more on creating a fine tuned model, check out our [guide](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/classification). \n\n\n\nOption 2: Transition to Embeddings-based search\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nAnother possible option, especially if your classification labels change frequently, is to use embeddings. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using a small dataset (<10,000 documents), consider using the techniques described in that guide to find the best documents to construct a prompt similar to [this](#h_e63b71a5c8). Then, you can just submit that prompt to our [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset, consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/beyond_search_openai/src/server.py) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 3: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to recreate the functionality of the Classifications endpoint, here\u2019s how we did it. This functionality is also mostly replicated in this [script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/classification_functionality_example.py).\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are two main ways you can use the classifications endpoint: you can source the data from an uploaded file or send it in with the request.\n\n\n\nIf you're using the document parameter\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one step if you provide the documents in the Classifications API call.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used: \n\n\n* Construct the prompt [with this format.](#h_e63b71a5c8)\n* Gather all of the provided documents. If they fit in the prompt, just use all of them.\n* Do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) (also being deprecated. Please see its [transition guide](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272952-search-transition-guide)) where the documents are the user provided documents and the query is the query from above. Rank the documents by score.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the context. Try to maximize the number of distinct labels as that will help the model understand the different labels that are available.\n* Request a completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc)\n\nThroughout all of this, you\u2019ll need to check that the prompt\u2019s length doesn\u2019t exceed [the model's token limit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/gpt-3). To assess the number of tokens present in a prompt, we recommend <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast>. \n\n\n\nIf you're using the file parameter\n----------------------------------\n\n\nStep 1: upload a jsonl file\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, we upload new files meant for classifications to an Elastic search. Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nIn each line we require a \u201ctext\u201d field, a \u201clabel\u201d field, and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"label\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"},  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_examples` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used. Our end goal is to create a [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) request [with this format](#h_e63b71a5c8). It will look very similar to [Documents](#h_51fe4aed6d).\n\n\n\nFrom there, our steps are: \n\n\n* Start with the `experimental\\_alternative\\_question` or, if that's not provided, what\u2019s in the `question` field. Call that the query.\n* Query Elastic search for `max\\_examples` documents with query as the search param.\n* Take those documents and do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) on them where the entries from Elastic search are the docs, and the query is the query that you used above. Use the score from the search to rank the documents.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the prompt. Try to maximize the number of distinct labels as that will help the model understand the different labels that are available.\n* Request an OpenAI completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc). Return that generation to the user.\n\n\nCompletion Prompt\n-----------------\n\n\n\n```\n#{{ an optional instruction }}  \n  \nText: #{{example 1 text}}  \nCategory: #{{example 1 label}}  \n---  \nText: #{{example 2 text}}  \nCategory: #{{example 2 label}}  \n---  \nText: #{{question}}  \nCategory:\n```\n\n", "title": "Classifications Transition Guide", "article_id": "6272941", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272941-classifications-transition-guide"}

{"text": "*This article is only relevant if you started using the API before June 6, 2022.*\n\n\n\nWe are deprecating the term \u2018engine\u2019 in favor of \u2018model\u2019.

Learn more about our Enterprise privacy commitments [here](https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy). \n\n\n\n**If I delete my account can I create a new account with the same email?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. You cannot create a new account using the same email address.\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/925080821/de3ef0750cb15fbef5602d66/Screenshot+2024-01-04+at+10.40.29%E2%80%AFAM.png)\n**Can I reactivate my account after it's been deleted?**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. But you can create a new account with a different email address.\n\n\n\nClick \u201cSign up\u201d on the [ChatGPT login page](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) or our [API login page](https://platform.openai.com/login). There are a couple caveats of which to be mindful:\n\n\n* Email addresses: **You'll need to use a new email address**.\n\n\n\t+ Since every email address is unique per account, we require a different email address for new accounts. If you don't have an alternative email address, you can try using what's known as an email subaddress: instead of [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com), try [jane+alt@example.com](mailto:jane+alt@example.com). Emails to this address should still go to the same inbox (everything after the + is typically ignored by your email provider), but we'll treat this as a unique email address.\n* Phone numbers: New accounts are still subject to our limit of [3 accounts per phone number](https://help.openai.com/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq#h_de13bb96c0). Deleted accounts also count toward this limit. Deleting an account does not free up another spot. A phone number can only ever be used up to 3 times for verification to generate the first API key for your account on platform.openai.com.\n\n\n\t+ Phone verification is **not** required to create an OpenAI account.\n\t+ Phone verification is required for a new account to generate their first API key on platform.openai.com.\n\n**We don't support unlinking a phone number from an existing account**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do not allow you to unlink phone numbers from existing accounts.\n\n\n\n\n**How many times can I use my phone number to create OpenAI accounts?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nSee our [Phone Verification FAQ](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq).\n\n\n\nCan I change my authentication method after account deletion?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Deleting your account does **NOT** allow you to change your authentication method.\n\n\nThat said, if you originally signed up for OpenAI / ChatGPT **with an email and password** then in future logins you can choose Google/Apple login allowing users in that situation to then login either way.\n\n", "title": "How to delete your account", "article_id": "6378407", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-to-delete-your-account"}

Make sure to download often to avoid losing work due to browser freezes!\n\nThe FAQ below will help you learn how to get the most out of these new tools:\n\n\n\nHow do I access the DALL\u00b7E editor?\n==================================\n\n\nOnce you're logged in on a desktop device, you can launch the editor in two ways:\n\n\n* **Start with an image**: From any image on the DALL-E website, you can click the \"Edit\" button to drop into an editor with that image as the starting point.\n* **Start with a blank canvas:** If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can bookmark and use the following URL: https://labs.openai.com/editor\n\nWhile users on mobile devices don't have access to advanced editor features like outpainting, you can still inpaint images by tapping \"Edit\" on an existing image you've generated or uploaded.\n\n\n\nHow much does usage of the DALL\u00b7E editor cost?\n==============================================\n\n\nLike DALL\u00b7E's other functionality, each prompt you submit by clicking the \"Generate\" button will deduct one credit from your credit balance (regardless of how many pixels you are filling in).\n\n\n\nYou can always purchase additional credits from the user dropdown at the top right of the application.\n\n\n\nHow do I use the editor most effectively?\n=========================================\n\n\nThe **Generation frame** contains the image context that the model will see when you submit a text prompt, so make sure that it contains enough useful context for the area you are expanding into, otherwise the style may drift from the rest of your image.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/571876595/9e431c455e24421079bee9d3/Screen+Shot+2022-08-30+at+2.55.38+PM.png)You can simultaneously **Erase** parts of your image to touch up or replace certain areas, and perfect the finer details.\n\n\n\nYou can also **Upload** existing images, optionally resize them, and then place them within the canvas to bring additional imagery into the scene. This is a powerful feature that enables you to fuse images together, connect opposite ends of an image for loops, and \"uncrop\" images that you can combine with other tooling to create recursively expanding animations.\n\n\n\nThe **Download** tool will export the latest state of the artwork as .png file. We recommend downloading often to keep snapshots of your work. You can always re-upload previous snapshots to continue where you left off.\n\n\n\nWhat keyboard shortcuts are supported?\n======================================\n\n\nThe editor supports keyboard shortcuts for zooming, switching tools, undo/redo, and more. Press **?** while using the editor to show the full list of keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\n\nAre there any other tips & tricks to be aware of?\n=================================================\n\n\n* Start with the character before the landscape, if there are characters involved, so you can get the body morphology right before filling the rest.\n* Make sure you're keeping enough of the existing image in the generation frame to avoid the style drifting too much.\n* Ask DALL\u00b7E for a muted color palette, especially as you stray further from the center, to avoid oversaturation and color-blasting.\n* Consider what story you\u2019re trying to tell when picking the direction you want to expand the image into.\n\n\n\n", "title": "DALL\u00b7E Editor Guide", "article_id": "6516417", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6516417-dall-e-editor-guide"}

This allows us to verify your account and ensure our platform remains secure. \n\n\n\nYou only need to complete phone verification generating the 1st API key not any subsequent API keys after that.\n\n\n\nWe don't use your phone number for any other purposes, and take your privacy very seriously.\n\n\n\nCan I use a premium number, landline, Google Voice, or other VoIP phone number?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do **`not`** support use of `landlines`, `VoIP`, `Google Voice`, or `premium numbers` at this time. All of those types of phone numbers are often associated with higher instances of fraud or abuse.\n\n\n\nFor this reason we only support completing phone verification via mobile phone numbers over an SMS text message, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHave you always blocked VoIP numbers?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nYes, we have always blocked VoIP services in the United States to ensure the safety and security of our users. Recently, we have expanded our blocking policy to include VoIP services internationally. This means that VoIP services are now blocked in countries outside the United States as well.\n\n\n\nI don't want to receive the SMS can I phone verify over email/call instead?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. The phone verification can only be completed with a text message via SMS (or WhatsApp, if available in your country). The code cannot be sent via email or done over phone call.\n\n\n\nWhy am I not receiving my phone verification code SMS?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you're not receiving your phone verification code, it's possible that our system has temporarily blocked you due to too many verification attempts or an issue occurred during your first request.\n\n\n\nPlease try again in a few hours and make sure you're within cellphone coverage, and you're not using any text-blocker applications.\n\n\n\nWhat does this error mean? \"Detected suspicious behavior from phone numbers similar to yours\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis means our system has detected unusual activity or patterns from phone numbers that are similar to the one you're using for verification. This error is triggered as a security measure to prevent potential fraud or abuse of the platform.\n\n\n\nRemember that security measures like this are in place to protect your account and maintain the integrity of the platform. Ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nHow many times can I use the same phone number to complete the phone verification associated with an OpenAI account's first API key generation?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nHow do free trial tokens work?\n------------------------------\n\n\nFree trial tokens to API users on platform.openai.com are only given for the first time you sign up then complete phone verification during the first API key generation. No accounts created after that get free trial tokens, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHow do I resolve I get an error that I can't sign up due to \"unsupported country\"?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis may be that you're trying to complete phone verification on the initial API key generation on platform.openai.com using a phone number from a country or territory we do not support.\n\n\n\nSee [Supported countries and territories](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries).\n\n\n\nWhich countries do you support for WhatsApp phone verification?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn certain countries you can complete phone verification with WhatsApp instead of via an SMS.\n\n\n\nAs of Wednesday, September 27th, 2023 the countries we support for that include:\n\n\n* \u201cIN\u201d, # India\n* \u201cID\u201d, # Indonesia\n* \u201cPK\u201d, # Pakistan\n* \u201cNG\u201d, # Nigeria\n* \u201cIL\u201d, # Israel\n* \u201cSA\u201d, # Saudi Arabia\n* \u201cAE\u201d, # United Arab Emirates\n* \u201cUA\u201d, # Ukraine\n* \u201cMY\u201d, # Malaysia\n* \u201cTR\u201d, # Turkey\n\n### What will phone verification look like?\n\n\nOur default drop-down is set to the United States which looks like this:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658048438/d0ae000cb03c874071cc470a/phone+verification+step+1.png)Then if you select one of the countries in our list above which include the WhatsApp alternative phone verification option - using India as an example - you'll see this UI:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049199/9d36ef51ff688434496e9a60/phone+verification+step+2.png)Then to get your code sent to WhatsApp you can select \"YES\" and that option appears:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049679/e35901be2b3899487a0d7c46/phone+verification+step+3.png)", "title": "Phone verification FAQ", "article_id": "6613520", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq"}

The higher the `temperature`, the more random (and usually creative) the output. This, however, is not the same as \u201ctruthfulness\u201d. For most factual use cases such as data extraction, and truthful Q&A, the `temperature` of 0 is best.\n3. **`max_tokens`** (**maximum length)** - Does not control the length of the output, but a hard cutoff limit for token generation. Ideally you won\u2019t hit this limit often, as your model will stop either when it thinks it\u2019s finished, or when it hits a stop sequence you defined.\n4. **`stop` (stop sequences)** - A set of characters (tokens) that, when generated, will cause the text generation to stop.\n\nFor other parameter descriptions see the [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).\n\n\n\n\n**Additional Resources**\n========================\n\n\nIf you're interested in additional resources, we recommend:\n\n\n* Guides\n\n\n\t+ [Text completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/completion/text-completion) - learn how to generate or edit text using our models\n\t+ [Code completion](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/code/code-completion-private-beta) - explore prompt engineering for Codex\n\t+ [Fine-tuning](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/fine-tuning) - Learn how to train a custom model for your use case\n\t+ [Embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/embeddings) - learn how to search, classify, and compare text\n\t+ [Moderation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/moderation)\n* [OpenAI cookbook repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/examples) - contains example code and prompts for accomplishing common tasks with the API, including Question-answering with Embeddings\n* [Community Forum](https://community.openai.com/)\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "Best practices for prompt engineering with OpenAI API", "article_id": "6654000", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6654000-best-practices-for-prompt-engineering-with-openai-api"}

{"text": "**Have you ever tried to solve for x using the OpenAI playground?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFor example, solve for x:\n\n\n3 x + 4 = 66\n\n\nFirst you'd isolate terms with *x* to the left hand side like so:\n\n\n3 x + (4 - 4) = 66 - 4\n\n\nthen:\n\n\n3 x = 62\n\n\nto get the result:\n\n\nx = 62 / 3\n\n\n\n... simple, right? Unfortunately, you won\u2019t always get the same result from the [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).\n\n\n\n**Our language models currently struggle with math**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems. In other words if you were to try this example in our Playground using text-davinci-002 you will likely get inconsistent answers when performing math. With some generations you will get the correct answer, however we do not recommend you depend on the GPT models for math tasks.\n\n\n\n**What you can do to improve output consistency in our Playground**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Disclaimer**: Even implementing everything below there is only so far we can push the current model.\n\n\n1. The GPT models are great at recognizing patterns, but without enough data they\u2019ll try their best to interpret and recreate a pattern that seems most probable. With minimal data it\u2019s likely to produce a wide variety of potential outputs.\n2. A prompt designed like a homework assignment, will generally have clear instructions on the task and expected output, and may include an example task to further establish the expectations around the task and output format. The text-davinci-002 model does best with an instruction, so the request should be presented in a format that starts with an instruction. Without this the model may not understand your expectations and it will be a bit confused.\n\n**Using the \"solve for x where 3x + 4 = 66\" example:**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo improve this [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/undsPkd4LAdmFC4SILzvnJ6e) we can add the following:\n\n\n1. Start with an instruction like, \u201cGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable\u201d, then test to see the results.\n2. Append to the instruction a description of the expected output, \u201cProvide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>\u2019\u201c, then test once more\n3. If results are still inconsistent, append an example problem to the instructions. This example will help establish the pattern that you want the model to recognize and follow, \u201cProblem: 3x+4=66, solve for x. <newline> Answer: x=\u201d\n4. The final result will be a [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/I4yzqABsUqjQASw6CwM1OftR) that looks like this:\n\n\n```\nGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable. Provide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>.   \nProblem1: y-1=0, solve for y  \nAnswer1: y=1  \n---  \nProblem2: 3x+4=66, solve for x.  \nAnswer2: x=\n```\n\n\n**Overall recommendation for math problems**\n\n\nWe are aware our currently available models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems. Consider relying on tools like<https://www.wolframalpha.com/> for now when doing math such as algebraic equations.\n\n", "title": "Doing Math in the Playground", "article_id": "6681258", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6681258-doing-math-in-the-playground"}

It has limited knowledge of world and events after 2021 and may also occasionally produce harmful instructions or biased content.\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\tWe'd recommend checking whether responses from the model are accurate or not. If you find an answer is incorrect, please provide that feedback by using the \"Thumbs Down\" button.\n5. **Who can view my conversations?**\n\n\n\t* As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements.\n6. **Will you use my conversations for training?**\n\n\n\t* Yes. Your conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems.\n7. **Can you delete my data?**\n\n\n\t* Yes, please follow the [data deletion process](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-can-i-delete-my-account).\n8. **Can you delete specific prompts?**\n\n\n\t* No, we are not able to delete specific prompts from your history. Please don't share any sensitive information in your conversations.\n9. **Can I see my history of threads? How can I save a conversation I\u2019ve had?**\n\n\n\t* Yes, you can now view and continue your past conversations.\n10. **Where do you save my personal and conversation data?**\n\n\n\t* For more information on how we handle data, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/).\n11. **How can I implement this? Is there any implementation guide for this?**\n\n\n\t* Developers can [now](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-and-whisper-apis) integrate ChatGPT into their applications and products through our API. Users can expect continuous model improvements and the option to choose dedicated capacity for deeper control over the models. To learn more, please check out the documentation [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat).\n12. **Do I need a new account if I already have a Labs or Playground account?**\n\n\n\t* If you have an existing account at [labs.openai.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://labs.openai.com&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669833084818742&usg=AOvVaw3xrSlGIVLLVKjnchqinjLs) or [beta.openai.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://beta.openai.com&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669833084818875&usg=AOvVaw11EJaho-h4CU4I-OMT7x3j), then you can login directly at [chat.openai.com](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://chat.openai.com&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1669833084818926&usg=AOvVaw13rLwSrAYiV5hOL5oPsYDq) using the same login information.

{"text": "Fine-tuning with GPT-3.5\n========================\n\n\nFine-tuning data provides models with examples of how it should respond do a given conversation. We'll want these examples to match the input that the model will see in production as closely as possible. \n\n\n\n#### First, system instructions.\n\n\nThese tell the model how to act, and supply any contextual information. You should use the prompt used in the training dataset when calling the fine-tuned model.\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"}\n```\n\n#### \n**Second,** conversation **data.**\n\n\nWe'll want to provide varied examples of conversations that the model may run into, such as \"What's the capital of France?\" and \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}\n```\n\n#### Next, the assistant response.\n\n\nHere, we present the model with an example of how to respond to the previous message, given the system instruction. For our snarky assistant, we may choose a response like this:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}\n```\n\n\n#### Finally, putting it all together.\n\n\nOnce we have many examples, we can put these all together and begin training. Our dataset should look like follows:\n\n\n\n\n```\n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},    \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the capital of France?\"}  \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Paris, as if everyone doesn't know that already.\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who wrote 'Romeo and Juliet'?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Oh, just some guy named William Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?\"}]}  \n  \n{\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"Marv is a factual chatbot that is also sarcastic.\"},   \n{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"How far is the Moon from Earth?\"},   \n{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Around 384,400 kilometers. Give or take a few, like that really matters.\"}]}\n```\n\n\n\nFine-tuning with babbage and davinci\n====================================\n\n\nTo fine-tune effectively without ChatCompletions, you need to format your data properly to provide clues to the model about where to start and stop generating text. \n\n\n\n**Indicator String** \n\n\nThe indicator string is a symbol or sequence of symbols that you append to the end of your prompt to tell the model that you want it to start generating text after this string. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to categorize items as colors, you can use an indicator string like '->'. The prompts in your dataset would look like this:\n\n\n* 'banana ->'\n* 'lime ->'\n* 'tomato ->'\n\nYou can use any string as an indicator string as long as it doesn't appear anywhere else in the dataset. We recommend using '\\n###\\n'.\n\n\n\n**Stop Sequence**\n\n\nThe stop sequence is another special symbol or sequence of symbols that you use to tell the model that you want it to stop generating text after that point. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to generate one word as a completion, you can use a stop sequence such as \"\\n\" (newline) or \".\" (period) to mark the end of the completion, like this: \n\n\n* 'prompt' : 'banana ->', 'completion' : ' yellow \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'lime ->', 'completion' : ' green \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'tomato ->', 'completion' : ' red \\n'\n\n\n**Calling the model**\n\n\nYou should use the same symbols used in your dataset when calling the model. If you used the dataset above, you should use '\\n' as a stop sequence. You should also append '->' to your prompts as an indicator string (e.g. prompt: 'lemon -> ')\n\n\n\nIt is important that you use consistent and unique symbols for the indicator string and the stop sequence, and that they don't appear anywhere else in your data. Otherwise, the model might get confused and generate unwanted or incorrect text. \n\n\n\n**Extra Recommendations**\n\n\nWe also recommend appending a single space character at the beginning of your outputs. \n\n\n\nYou can also use our [command line tool](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/cli-data-preparation-tool) to help format your dataset, after you have prepared it.\n\n", "title": "How do I format my fine-tuning data?", "article_id": "6811186", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6811186-how-do-i-format-my-fine-tuning-data"}

{"text": "How can I tell how many tokens a string will have before I try to embed it?\n===========================================================================\n\n\nFor V2 embedding models, as of Dec 2022, there is not yet a way to split a string into tokens. The only way to get total token counts is to submit an API request.\n\n\n* If the request succeeds, you can extract the number of tokens from the response: `response[\u201cusage\u201d][\u201ctotal\\_tokens\u201d]`\n* If the request fails for having too many tokens, you can extract the number of tokens from the error message: `This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 10000 tokens (10000 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.`\n\n\nFor V1 embedding models, which are based on GPT-2/GPT-3 tokenization, you can count tokens in a few ways:\n\n\n* For one-off checks, the [OpenAI tokenizer](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer) page is convenient\n* In Python, [transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast) (the GPT-2 tokenizer is the same as GPT-3)\n* In JavaScript, [gpt-3-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-3-encoder)\n\n\nHow can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\n=======================================================\n\n\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database.\n\n\n\nVector database options include:\n\n\n* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a fully managed vector database\n* [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), an open-source vector search engine\n* [Faiss](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/), a vector search algorithm by Facebook\n\nWhich distance function should I use?\n=====================================\n\n\nWe recommend [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). The choice of distance function typically doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n\n\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\n\n\n* Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\n* Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings\n", "title": "Embeddings - Frequently Asked Questions", "article_id": "6824809", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6824809-embeddings-frequently-asked-questions"}

Toggle on the features you\u2019d like to try\n\nFor more information on our rollout process, please check out the article [here](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7897380-introducing-new-features-in-chatgpt). \n\n\n\nIn addition to the beta panel, users can now choose to continue generating a message beyond the maximum token limit. Each continuation counts towards the message allowance.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (May 3, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n* You can now turn off chat history and export your data from the ChatGPT settings. Conversations that are started when chat history is disabled won\u2019t be used to train and improve our models, and won\u2019t appear in the history sidebar.\n* We are deprecating the Legacy (GPT-3.5) model on May 10th. Users will be able to continue their existing conversations with this model, but new messages will use the default model.\n\nIntroducing plugins in ChatGPT (March 23, 2023)\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe are announcing experimental support for AI plugins in ChatGPT \u2014 tools designed specifically for language models. Plugins can help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, or use third-party services. You can learn more about plugins [here](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins).\n\n\n\nToday, we will begin extending plugin access to users and developers from our waitlist. The plugins we are rolling out with are:\n\n\n* Browsing: An experimental model that knows when and how to browse the internet\n* Code Interpreter: An experimental ChatGPT model that can use Python, and handles uploads and downloads\n* Third-party plugins: An experimental model that knows when and how to use external plugins.\n\nYou can join the waitlist to try plugins here:\n\n\n* [ChatGPT Plugin Waitlist](https://share.hsforms.com/16C8k9E5FR5mRLYYkwohdiQ4sk30)\n\nAnnouncing GPT-4 in ChatGPT (March 14, 2023)\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019re excited to bring GPT-4, our latest model, to our ChatGPT Plus subscribers. \n\n\n\nGPT-4 has enhanced capabilities in:\n\n\n* Advanced reasoning\n* Complex instructions\n* More creativity\n\nTo give every Plus subscriber a chance to try the model, we'll dynamically adjust the cap for GPT-4 usage based on demand. You can learn more about GPT-4 [here](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4).\n\n\n\nFor this release, there are no updates to free accounts.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Feb 13, 2023)\n---------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve made several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n* We\u2019ve updated performance of the ChatGPT model on our free plan in order to serve more users.\n* Based on user feedback, we are now defaulting Plus users to a faster version of ChatGPT, formerly known as \u201cTurbo\u201d. We\u2019ll keep the previous version around for a while.\n* We rolled out the ability to purchase [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) internationally.\n\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Plus (Feb 9 2023)\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nAs we recently announced, our Plus plan comes with early access to new, experimental features. We are beginning to roll out a way for Plus users the ability to choose between different versions of ChatGPT: \n\n\n* Default: the standard ChatGPT model\n* Turbo: optimized for speed (alpha)\n\nVersion selection is made easy with a dedicated dropdown menu at the top of the page. Depending on feedback, we may roll out this feature (or just Turbo) to all users soon.\n\n\n\nFactuality and mathematical improvements (Jan 30, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve upgraded the ChatGPT model with improved factuality and mathematical capabilities.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Jan 9, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. We made more improvements to the ChatGPT model! It should be generally better across a wide range of topics and has improved factuality.\n2. Stop generating: Based on your feedback, we've added the ability to stop generating ChatGPT's response\n\n\nPerformance updates to ChatGPT (Dec 15, 2022)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. General performance: Among other improvements, users will notice that ChatGPT is now less likely to refuse to answer questions.\n2. Conversation history: You\u2019ll soon be able to view past conversations with ChatGPT, rename your saved conversations and delete the ones you don\u2019t want to keep. We are gradually rolling out this feature.\n3. Daily limit: To ensure a high-quality experience for all ChatGPT users, we are experimenting with a daily message cap. If you\u2019re included in this group, you\u2019ll be presented with an option to extend your access by providing feedback to ChatGPT.\n\nTo see if you\u2019re using the updated version, look for \u201cChatGPT Dec 15 Version\u201d at the bottom of the screen.\n\n", "title": "ChatGPT \u2014 Release Notes", "article_id": "6825453", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6825453-chatgpt-release-notes"}

You can find your API key at https://beta.openai.com\n```\n\n\nHere are a few simple steps you can take to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Clear your browser's cache\n\n\nThe first step is to clear your browser's cache. Sometimes, your browser may hold onto an outdated version of your API key, which can cause this error message to appear. To clear your browser's cache, follow the instructions for your specific browser:\n\n\n* For Google Chrome, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"History.\" Then, click on \"Clear browsing data\" and select \"Cookies and other site data\" and \"Cached images and files.\"\n* For Firefox, click on the three lines in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"Options.\" Then, click on \"Privacy & Security\" and scroll down to \"Cookies and Site Data.\" Click on \"Clear Data\" and select \"Cookies and Site Data\" and \"Cached Web Content.\"\n* For Safari, click on \"Safari\" in the top menu bar and select \"Preferences.\" Then, click on the \"Privacy\" tab and click on \"Manage Website Data.\" Select \"Remove All\" to clear your browser's cache.\n\nStep 2: Retry your request\n\n\nAfter clearing your browser's cache, try your request again. If the error message still appears, then move to the next step.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Check your API key\n\n\nCheck your API key at **[https://beta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/)** and verify it with the API key shown in the error message. Sometimes, the error message may include an old or incorrect API key that you no longer use. Double-check that you are using the correct API key for the request you're making.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that you're not using two different API keys\n\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have accidentally used two different API keys. Make sure that you are using the same API key throughout your application or script and not switching between different keys.\n\n\n\nIf you still need help please reach out to our support team, and they will assist you with resolving the issue.\n\n\n  \n\u200b\n\n\n\n", "title": "Incorrect API key provided", "article_id": "6882433", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6882433-incorrect-api-key-provided"}

This rate limit has been hit by the request.\n\n\n\nRate limits can be quantized, meaning they are enforced over shorter periods of time (e.g. 60,000 requests/minute may be enforced as 1,000 requests/second). Sending short bursts of requests or contexts (prompts+max\\_tokens) that are too long can lead to rate limit errors, even when you are technically below the rate limit per minute.\n\n\n\n**How can I fix it?**\n\n\n* Include [exponential back-off](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_handle_rate_limits.ipynb) logic in your code.

# Personal shopper

This Swarm is a personal shopping agent that can help with making sales and refunding orders.
This example uses the helper function `run_demo_loop`, which allows us to create an interactive Swarm session.
In this example, we also use a Sqlite3 database with customer information and transaction data.

## Overview

The personal shopper example includes three main agents to handle various customer service requests:

1. **Triage Agent**: Determines the type of request and transfers to the appropriate agent.
2. **Refund Agent**: Manages customer refunds, requiring both user ID and item ID to initiate a refund.
3. **Sales Agent**: Handles actions related to placing orders, requiring both user ID and product ID to complete a purchase.

## Setup

Once you have installed dependencies and Swarm, run the example using:

```shell
python3 main.py
```

# Support bot

This example is a customer service bot which includes a user interface agent and a help center agent with several tools.
This example uses the helper function `run_demo_loop`, which allows us to create an interactive Swarm session.

## Overview

The support bot consists of two main agents:

1. **User Interface Agent**: Handles initial user interactions and directs them to the help center agent based on their needs.
2. **Help Center Agent**: Provides detailed help and support using various tools and integrated with a Qdrant VectorDB for documentation retrieval.

## Setup

To start the support bot:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
2. Install the necessary additional libraries:

```shell
make install
```

3. Initialize docker

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Prepare the vector DB:

```shell
make prep
```

5. Run the main scripy:

```shell
make run
```

New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/answers> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/answers>\n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Answers endpoint:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524217540/51eda23e171f33f1b9d5acff/rM6ZVI3XZ2CpxcEStmG5mFy6ATBCskmX2g3_GPmeY3FicvrWfJCuFOtzsnbkpMQe-TQ6hi5j1BV9cFo7bCDcsz8VWxFfeOnC1Gb4QNaeVYtJq4Qtg76SBOLLk-jgHUA8mWZ0QgOuV636UgcvMA)All of these options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints)\n\n\n\nOption 1: Transition to Embeddings-based search (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving the underlying search system to use a vector-based embedding search. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our embeddings system has much more contextual awareness. Also, in general, using embeddings will be considerably lower cost in the long run. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using a small dataset (<10,000 documents), consider using the techniques described in that guide to find the best documents to construct a prompt similar to [this](#h_89196129b2). Then, you can just submit that prompt to our [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) endpoint.\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset, consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://share.streamlit.io/pinecone-io/playground/beyond_search_openai/src/server.py) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to recreate the functionality of the Answers endpoint, here\u2019s how we did it. There is also a [script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/answers_functionality_example.py) that replicates most of this functionality.\n\n\n\nAt a high level, there are two main ways you can use the answers endpoint: you can source the data from an uploaded file or send it in with the request.\n\n\n\n**If you\u2019re using the document parameter**\n------------------------------------------\n\n\nThere\u2019s only one step if you provide the documents in the Answers API call.\n\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used: \n\n\n* Construct the prompt [with this format.](#h_89196129b2)\n* Gather all of the provided documents. If they fit in the prompt, just use all of them.\n* Do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) (note that this is also being deprecated and has a [transition guide](https://app.intercom.com/a/apps/dgkjq2bp/articles/articles/6272952/show)) where the documents are the user provided documents and the query is the query from above. Rank the documents by score.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the context.\n* Request a completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc)\n\n\nThroughout all of this, you\u2019ll need to check that the prompt\u2019s length doesn\u2019t exceed [the model's token limit](https://beta.openai.com/docs/engines/gpt-3). To assess the number of tokens present in a prompt, we recommend <https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast>. \n\n\n\nIf you're using the file parameter\n----------------------------------\n\n\nStep 1: upload a jsonl file\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, we upload new files meant for answers to an Elastic search cluster. Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nIf you uploaded the file with the purpose \u201canswers,\u201d we additionally split the documents on newlines and upload each of those chunks as separate documents to ensure that we can search across and reference the highest number of relevant text sections in the file.\n\n\n\nEach line requires a \u201ctext\u201d field and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field.\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_rerank` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used. Our end goal is to create a [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) request [with this format](#h_89196129b2). It will look very similar to [Documents](#h_cb1d8a8d3f)\n\n\n\nFrom there, our steps are: \n\n\n* Start with the `experimental\\_alternative\\_question` or, if that's not provided, what\u2019s in the `question` field. Call that the query.\n* Query Elastic search for `max\\_rerank` documents with query as the search param.\n* Take those documents and do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) on them where the entries from Elastic search are the docs, and the query is the query that you used above. Use the score from the search to rank the documents.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the prompt.\n* Request an OpenAI completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc). Return that answer to the user.\n\n\nCompletion Prompt\n-----------------\n\n\n\n```\n===  \nContext: #{{ provided examples_context }}  \n===  \nQ: example 1 question  \nA: example 1 answer  \n---  \nQ: example 2 question  \nA: example 2 answer  \n(and so on for all examples provided in the request)   \n===  \nContext: #{{ what we return from Elasticsearch }}  \n===  \nQ: #{{ user provided question }}   \nA:\n```\n", "title": "Answers Transition Guide", "article_id": "6233728", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6233728-answers-transition-guide"}

Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nIn each line we require a \u201ctext\u201d field, a \u201clabel\u201d field, and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"label\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"},  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_examples` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nHere\u2019s roughly the steps we used. Our end goal is to create a [Completions](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions) request [with this format](#h_e63b71a5c8). It will look very similar to [Documents](#h_51fe4aed6d).\n\n\n\nFrom there, our steps are: \n\n\n* Start with the `experimental\\_alternative\\_question` or, if that's not provided, what\u2019s in the `question` field. Call that the query.\n* Query Elastic search for `max\\_examples` documents with query as the search param.\n* Take those documents and do an [OpenAI search](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches) on them where the entries from Elastic search are the docs, and the query is the query that you used above. Use the score from the search to rank the documents.\n* In order of score, attempt to add Elastic search documents until you run out of space in the prompt. Try to maximize the number of distinct labels as that will help the model understand the different labels that are available.\n* Request an OpenAI completion with the provided parameters (logit\\_bias, n, stop, etc). Return that generation to the user.\n\n\nCompletion Prompt\n-----------------\n\n\n\n```\n#{{ an optional instruction }}  \n  \nText: #{{example 1 text}}  \nCategory: #{{example 1 label}}  \n---  \nText: #{{example 2 text}}  \nCategory: #{{example 2 label}}  \n---  \nText: #{{question}}  \nCategory:\n```\n\n", "title": "Classifications Transition Guide", "article_id": "6272941", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272941-classifications-transition-guide"}

{"text": "Introduction\n============\n\n\n\u200bSince releasing the Search endpoint, we\u2019ve developed new methods that achieve better results for this task. As a result, we\u2019ll be removing the Search endpoint from our documentation and removing access to this endpoint for all organizations on December 3, 2022. New accounts created after June 3rd will not have access to this endpoint.\n\n\n\nWe strongly encourage developers to switch over to newer techniques which produce better results, outlined below.\n\n\n\nCurrent documentation\n---------------------\n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/search> \n\n\n<https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/searches> \n\n\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n\nThis options are also outlined [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints).\n\n\n\nOption 1: Transition to Embeddings-based search (recommended)\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe believe that most use cases will be better served by moving the underlying search system to use a vector-based embedding search. The major reason for this is that our current system used a bigram filter to narrow down the scope of candidates whereas our embeddings system has much more contextual awareness. Also, in general, using embeddings will be considerably lower cost in the long run. If you\u2019re not familiar with this, you can learn more by visiting our [guide to embeddings](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/use-cases).\n\n\n\nIf you have a larger dataset (>10,000 documents), consider using a vector search engine like [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io) or [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/retriever-vectorizer-modules/text2vec-openai.html) to power that search.\n\n\n\nOption 2: Reimplement existing functionality\n--------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using the document parameter\n--------------------------------------\n\n\nThe current openai.Search.create and openai.Engine.search code can be replaced with this [snippet](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/transition_guides_for_deprecated_API_endpoints/search_functionality_example.py) (note this will only work with non-Codex engines since they use a different tokenizer.)\n\n\n\nWe plan to move this snippet into the openai-python repo under openai.Search.create\\_legacy.\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019re using the file parameter\n----------------------------------\n\n\nAs a quick review, here are the high level steps of the current Search endpoint with a file:\n\n\n\n\n![](https://openai.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/524222854/57382ab799ebe9bb988c0a1f/_y63ycSmtiFAS3slJdbfW0Mz-0nx2DP4gNAjyknMAmTT1fQUE9d7nha5yfsXJLkWRFmM41uvjPxi2ToSW4vrF7EcasiQDG51CrKPNOpXPVG4WZXI8jC8orWSmuGhAGGC4KoUYucwJOh0bH9Nzw)\n\n\nStep 1: upload a jsonl file\n\n\n\nBehind the scenes, we upload new files meant for file search to an Elastic search. Each line of the jsonl is then submitted as a document.\n\n\n\nEach line is required to have a \u201ctext\u201d field and an optional \u201cmetadata\u201d field.\n\n\n\nThese are the Elastic search settings and mappings for our index:\n\n\n\n[Elastic searching mapping](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html): \n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"properties\": {  \n        \"document\": {\"type\": \"text\", \"analyzer\": \"standard_bigram_analyzer\"}, -> the \u201ctext\u201d field  \n        \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"enabled\": False}, -> the \u201cmetadata\u201d field  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\n[Elastic search analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html):\n\n\n\n```\n{  \n    \"analysis\": {  \n        \"analyzer\": {  \n            \"standard_bigram_analyzer\": {  \n                \"type\": \"custom\",  \n                \"tokenizer\": \"standard\",  \n                \"filter\": [\"lowercase\", \"english_stop\", \"shingle\"],  \n            }  \n        },  \n        \"filter\": {\"english_stop\": {\"type\": \"stop\", \"stopwords\": \"_english_\"}},  \n    }  \n}\n```\n\n\nAfter that, we performed [standard Elastic search search calls](https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/v8.2.0/api.html#elasticsearch.Elasticsearch.search) and used `max\\_rerank` to determine the number of documents to return from Elastic search.\n\n\n\nStep 2: Search\n\n\nOnce you have the candidate documents from step 1, you could just make a standard openai.Search.create or openai.Engine.search call to rerank the candidates. See [Document](#h_f6ab294756)\n\n", "title": "Search Transition Guide", "article_id": "6272952", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6272952-search-transition-guide"}

{"text": "*This article is only relevant if you started using the API before June 6, 2022.*\n\n\n\nWe are deprecating the term \u2018engine\u2019 in favor of \u2018model\u2019. Most people already use these terms interchangeably, and we consistently hear that \u2018model\u2019 is more intuitive. \n\n\n\nMoving forward, API requests will work by referencing a \u2018model\u2019 instead of an \u2018engine\u2019. If you have used a fine-tuned model, then you are already familiar with using \u2018model\u2019 instead of \u2018engine\u2019 when making an API request. Engine listing is also being replaced by Model listing, which will consolidate both base and fine-tuned models in a single place.\n\n\n\n**We will maintain backward compatibility for requests using \u2018engine\u2019 as a parameter, but recommend updating your implementation as soon as you can to prevent future confusion.**\n\n\n\nFor example, a request to the completions endpoint would now be (full details in our [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference)):\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Deprecated** | **Current** |\n| \n```\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(  engine=\"text-davinci-002\",  prompt=\u201dSay hello world three times.\u201d,  temperature=0.6)\n```\n | \n```\nresponse = openai.Completion.create(  model=\"text-davinci-002\",  prompt=\u201dSay hello world three times.\u201d,  temperature=0.6)\n```\n |\n| \n```\nopenai api completions.create -e text-davinci-002 -p \"Say hello world three times.\"\n```\n\n | \n```\nopenai api completions.create -m text-davinci-002 -p \"Say hello world three times.\"\n```\n\n |\n| \n```\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/text-davinci-002/completions \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\-H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\-d '{\"prompt\": \"Say hello world three times\", \"temperature\": 0.6}'\n```\n | \n```\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/completions \\-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\-H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\" \\-d '{\"prompt\": \"Say hello world three times\",\"model\":\"text-davinci-002\", \"temperature\": 0.6}'\n```\n |\n\nWe have updated endpoint URL paths accordingly (full details in our [API reference](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference)):\n\n\n\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Deprecated** | **Current** |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/completions\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/completions\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/embeddings\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/models\n```\n |\n| \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/engines/{engine_id}/edits\n```\n | \n```\nhttps://api.openai.com/v1/edits\n```\n |\n\n\n\n", "title": "What happened to \u2018engines\u2019?", "article_id": "6283125", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6283125-what-happened-to-engines"}

There are a couple caveats of which to be mindful:\n\n\n* Email addresses: **You'll need to use a new email address**.\n\n\n\t+ Since every email address is unique per account, we require a different email address for new accounts. If you don't have an alternative email address, you can try using what's known as an email subaddress: instead of [jane@example.com](mailto:jane@example.com), try [jane+alt@example.com](mailto:jane+alt@example.com). Emails to this address should still go to the same inbox (everything after the + is typically ignored by your email provider), but we'll treat this as a unique email address.\n* Phone numbers: New accounts are still subject to our limit of [3 accounts per phone number](https://help.openai.com/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq#h_de13bb96c0). Deleted accounts also count toward this limit. Deleting an account does not free up another spot. A phone number can only ever be used up to 3 times for verification to generate the first API key for your account on platform.openai.com.\n\n\n\t+ Phone verification is **not** required to create an OpenAI account.\n\t+ Phone verification is required for a new account to generate their first API key on platform.openai.com.\n\n**We don't support unlinking a phone number from an existing account**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do not allow you to unlink phone numbers from existing accounts.\n\n\n\n\n**How many times can I use my phone number to create OpenAI accounts?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nSee our [Phone Verification FAQ](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq).\n\n\n\nCan I change my authentication method after account deletion?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Deleting your account does **NOT** allow you to change your authentication method.\n\n\nThat said, if you originally signed up for OpenAI / ChatGPT **with an email and password** then in future logins you can choose Google/Apple login allowing users in that situation to then login either way.\n\n", "title": "How to delete your account", "article_id": "6378407", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-to-delete-your-account"}

Make sure to download often to avoid losing work due to browser freezes!\n\nThe FAQ below will help you learn how to get the most out of these new tools:\n\n\n\nHow do I access the DALL\u00b7E editor?\n==================================\n\n\nOnce you're logged in on a desktop device, you can launch the editor in two ways:\n\n\n* **Start with an image**: From any image on the DALL-E website, you can click the \"Edit\" button to drop into an editor with that image as the starting point.\n* **Start with a blank canvas:** If you'd prefer to start from scratch, you can bookmark and use the following URL: https://labs.openai.com/editor\n\nWhile users on mobile devices don't have access to advanced editor features like outpainting, you can still inpaint images by tapping \"Edit\" on an existing image you've generated or uploaded.\n\n\n\nHow much does usage of the DALL\u00b7E editor cost?\n==============================================\n\n\nLike DALL\u00b7E's other functionality, each prompt you submit by clicking the \"Generate\" button will deduct one credit from your credit balance (regardless of how many pixels you are filling in).\n\n\n\nYou can always purchase additional credits from the user dropdown at the top right of the application.\n\n\n\nHow do I use the editor most effectively?\n=========================================\n\n\nThe **Generation frame** contains the image context that the model will see when you submit a text prompt, so make sure that it contains enough useful context for the area you are expanding into, otherwise the style may drift from the rest of your image.\n\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/571876595/9e431c455e24421079bee9d3/Screen+Shot+2022-08-30+at+2.55.38+PM.png)You can simultaneously **Erase** parts of your image to touch up or replace certain areas, and perfect the finer details.\n\n\n\nYou can also **Upload** existing images, optionally resize them, and then place them within the canvas to bring additional imagery into the scene. This is a powerful feature that enables you to fuse images together, connect opposite ends of an image for loops, and \"uncrop\" images that you can combine with other tooling to create recursively expanding animations.\n\n\n\nThe **Download** tool will export the latest state of the artwork as .png file. We recommend downloading often to keep snapshots of your work. You can always re-upload previous snapshots to continue where you left off.\n\n\n\nWhat keyboard shortcuts are supported?\n======================================\n\n\nThe editor supports keyboard shortcuts for zooming, switching tools, undo/redo, and more. Press **?** while using the editor to show the full list of keyboard shortcuts.\n\n\n\nAre there any other tips & tricks to be aware of?\n=================================================\n\n\n* Start with the character before the landscape, if there are characters involved, so you can get the body morphology right before filling the rest.\n* Make sure you're keeping enough of the existing image in the generation frame to avoid the style drifting too much.\n* Ask DALL\u00b7E for a muted color palette, especially as you stray further from the center, to avoid oversaturation and color-blasting.\n* Consider what story you\u2019re trying to tell when picking the direction you want to expand the image into.\n\n\n\n", "title": "DALL\u00b7E Editor Guide", "article_id": "6516417", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6516417-dall-e-editor-guide"}

{"text": "\n**ChatGPT**\n\n\nPhone verification is no longer required for new OpenAI account creation or ChatGPT usage.\n\n\n\n**API**\n\n\nPhone verification is now mandated on platform.openai.com for generating your initial API key, though not for any subsequent API key generation after that.\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need to provide my phone number to generate my **first** API key on **platform**.openai.com?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWhen you generate your first API key on platform.openai.com, we do require a phone number for security reasons. This allows us to verify your account and ensure our platform remains secure. \n\n\n\nYou only need to complete phone verification generating the 1st API key not any subsequent API keys after that.\n\n\n\nWe don't use your phone number for any other purposes, and take your privacy very seriously.\n\n\n\nCan I use a premium number, landline, Google Voice, or other VoIP phone number?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe do **`not`** support use of `landlines`, `VoIP`, `Google Voice`, or `premium numbers` at this time. All of those types of phone numbers are often associated with higher instances of fraud or abuse.\n\n\n\nFor this reason we only support completing phone verification via mobile phone numbers over an SMS text message, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHave you always blocked VoIP numbers?\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nYes, we have always blocked VoIP services in the United States to ensure the safety and security of our users. Recently, we have expanded our blocking policy to include VoIP services internationally. This means that VoIP services are now blocked in countries outside the United States as well.\n\n\n\nI don't want to receive the SMS can I phone verify over email/call instead?\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNo. The phone verification can only be completed with a text message via SMS (or WhatsApp, if available in your country). The code cannot be sent via email or done over phone call.\n\n\n\nWhy am I not receiving my phone verification code SMS?\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIf you're not receiving your phone verification code, it's possible that our system has temporarily blocked you due to too many verification attempts or an issue occurred during your first request.\n\n\n\nPlease try again in a few hours and make sure you're within cellphone coverage, and you're not using any text-blocker applications.\n\n\n\nWhat does this error mean? \"Detected suspicious behavior from phone numbers similar to yours\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis means our system has detected unusual activity or patterns from phone numbers that are similar to the one you're using for verification. This error is triggered as a security measure to prevent potential fraud or abuse of the platform.\n\n\n\nRemember that security measures like this are in place to protect your account and maintain the integrity of the platform. Ensure that your personal information is accurate and up-to-date.\n\n\n\nHow many times can I use the same phone number to complete the phone verification associated with an OpenAI account's first API key generation?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nA phone number can only ever be used for phone verification up to 3 times.\n\n\n\nThis means if you have 3 OpenAI accounts you can use the same number for all three when completing phone verification on each initial API key generation across those three accounts.\n\n\n\nFor anti-fraud and abuse reasons, we do **not** allow you to unlink phone numbers from OpenAI accounts to free up that number for reuse. This means deleting an OpenAI account does **not** free up the number to get around the limit. There is no workaround.\n\n\n\nHow do free trial tokens work?\n------------------------------\n\n\nFree trial tokens to API users on platform.openai.com are only given for the first time you sign up then complete phone verification during the first API key generation. No accounts created after that get free trial tokens, no exceptions.\n\n\n\nHow do I resolve I get an error that I can't sign up due to \"unsupported country\"?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThis may be that you're trying to complete phone verification on the initial API key generation on platform.openai.com using a phone number from a country or territory we do not support.\n\n\n\nSee [Supported countries and territories](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries).\n\n\n\nWhich countries do you support for WhatsApp phone verification?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nIn certain countries you can complete phone verification with WhatsApp instead of via an SMS.\n\n\n\nAs of Wednesday, September 27th, 2023 the countries we support for that include:\n\n\n* \u201cIN\u201d, # India\n* \u201cID\u201d, # Indonesia\n* \u201cPK\u201d, # Pakistan\n* \u201cNG\u201d, # Nigeria\n* \u201cIL\u201d, # Israel\n* \u201cSA\u201d, # Saudi Arabia\n* \u201cAE\u201d, # United Arab Emirates\n* \u201cUA\u201d, # Ukraine\n* \u201cMY\u201d, # Malaysia\n* \u201cTR\u201d, # Turkey\n\n### What will phone verification look like?\n\n\nOur default drop-down is set to the United States which looks like this:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658048438/d0ae000cb03c874071cc470a/phone+verification+step+1.png)Then if you select one of the countries in our list above which include the WhatsApp alternative phone verification option - using India as an example - you'll see this UI:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049199/9d36ef51ff688434496e9a60/phone+verification+step+2.png)Then to get your code sent to WhatsApp you can select \"YES\" and that option appears:\n\n\n![](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/658049679/e35901be2b3899487a0d7c46/phone+verification+step+3.png)", "title": "Phone verification FAQ", "article_id": "6613520", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6613520-phone-verification-faq"}

{"text": "**Have you ever tried to solve for x using the OpenAI playground?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nFor example, solve for x:\n\n\n3 x + 4 = 66\n\n\nFirst you'd isolate terms with *x* to the left hand side like so:\n\n\n3 x + (4 - 4) = 66 - 4\n\n\nthen:\n\n\n3 x = 62\n\n\nto get the result:\n\n\nx = 62 / 3\n\n\n\n... simple, right? Unfortunately, you won\u2019t always get the same result from the [Playground](https://beta.openai.com/playground).\n\n\n\n**Our language models currently struggle with math**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems. In other words if you were to try this example in our Playground using text-davinci-002 you will likely get inconsistent answers when performing math. With some generations you will get the correct answer, however we do not recommend you depend on the GPT models for math tasks.\n\n\n\n**What you can do to improve output consistency in our Playground**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n**Disclaimer**: Even implementing everything below there is only so far we can push the current model.\n\n\n1. The GPT models are great at recognizing patterns, but without enough data they\u2019ll try their best to interpret and recreate a pattern that seems most probable. With minimal data it\u2019s likely to produce a wide variety of potential outputs.\n2. A prompt designed like a homework assignment, will generally have clear instructions on the task and expected output, and may include an example task to further establish the expectations around the task and output format. The text-davinci-002 model does best with an instruction, so the request should be presented in a format that starts with an instruction. Without this the model may not understand your expectations and it will be a bit confused.\n\n**Using the \"solve for x where 3x + 4 = 66\" example:**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nTo improve this [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/undsPkd4LAdmFC4SILzvnJ6e) we can add the following:\n\n\n1. Start with an instruction like, \u201cGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable\u201d, then test to see the results.\n2. Append to the instruction a description of the expected output, \u201cProvide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>\u2019\u201c, then test once more\n3. If results are still inconsistent, append an example problem to the instructions. This example will help establish the pattern that you want the model to recognize and follow, \u201cProblem: 3x+4=66, solve for x. <newline> Answer: x=\u201d\n4. The final result will be a [prompt](https://beta.openai.com/playground/p/I4yzqABsUqjQASw6CwM1OftR) that looks like this:\n\n\n```\nGiven the algebraic equation below, solve for the provided variable. Provide the answer in the format of \u2018x=<insert answer>.   \nProblem1: y-1=0, solve for y  \nAnswer1: y=1  \n---  \nProblem2: 3x+4=66, solve for x.  \nAnswer2: x=\n```\n\n\n**Overall recommendation for math problems**\n\n\nWe are aware our currently available models are not yet capable at performing consistently when asked to solve math problems. Consider relying on tools like<https://www.wolframalpha.com/> for now when doing math such as algebraic equations.\n\n", "title": "Doing Math in the Playground", "article_id": "6681258", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6681258-doing-math-in-the-playground"}

Give or take a few, like that really matters.\"}]}\n```\n\n\n\nFine-tuning with babbage and davinci\n====================================\n\n\nTo fine-tune effectively without ChatCompletions, you need to format your data properly to provide clues to the model about where to start and stop generating text. \n\n\n\n**Indicator String** \n\n\nThe indicator string is a symbol or sequence of symbols that you append to the end of your prompt to tell the model that you want it to start generating text after this string. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to categorize items as colors, you can use an indicator string like '->'. The prompts in your dataset would look like this:\n\n\n* 'banana ->'\n* 'lime ->'\n* 'tomato ->'\n\nYou can use any string as an indicator string as long as it doesn't appear anywhere else in the dataset. We recommend using '\\n###\\n'.\n\n\n\n**Stop Sequence**\n\n\nThe stop sequence is another special symbol or sequence of symbols that you use to tell the model that you want it to stop generating text after that point. \n\n\n\nFor example, if you want the model to generate one word as a completion, you can use a stop sequence such as \"\\n\" (newline) or \".\" (period) to mark the end of the completion, like this: \n\n\n* 'prompt' : 'banana ->', 'completion' : ' yellow \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'lime ->', 'completion' : ' green \\n'\n* 'prompt' : 'tomato ->', 'completion' : ' red \\n'\n\n\n**Calling the model**\n\n\nYou should use the same symbols used in your dataset when calling the model. If you used the dataset above, you should use '\\n' as a stop sequence. You should also append '->' to your prompts as an indicator string (e.g. prompt: 'lemon -> ')\n\n\n\nIt is important that you use consistent and unique symbols for the indicator string and the stop sequence, and that they don't appear anywhere else in your data. Otherwise, the model might get confused and generate unwanted or incorrect text. \n\n\n\n**Extra Recommendations**\n\n\nWe also recommend appending a single space character at the beginning of your outputs. \n\n\n\nYou can also use our [command line tool](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/cli-data-preparation-tool) to help format your dataset, after you have prepared it.\n\n",

{"text": "How can I tell how many tokens a string will have before I try to embed it?\n===========================================================================\n\n\nFor V2 embedding models, as of Dec 2022, there is not yet a way to split a string into tokens. The only way to get total token counts is to submit an API request.\n\n\n* If the request succeeds, you can extract the number of tokens from the response: `response[\u201cusage\u201d][\u201ctotal\\_tokens\u201d]`\n* If the request fails for having too many tokens, you can extract the number of tokens from the error message: `This model's maximum context length is 8191 tokens, however you requested 10000 tokens (10000 in your prompt; 0 for the completion). Please reduce your prompt; or completion length.`\n\n\nFor V1 embedding models, which are based on GPT-2/GPT-3 tokenization, you can count tokens in a few ways:\n\n\n* For one-off checks, the [OpenAI tokenizer](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer) page is convenient\n* In Python, [transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/gpt2#transformers.GPT2TokenizerFast) (the GPT-2 tokenizer is the same as GPT-3)\n* In JavaScript, [gpt-3-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gpt-3-encoder)\n\n\nHow can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\n=======================================================\n\n\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database.\n\n\n\nVector database options include:\n\n\n* [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/), a fully managed vector database\n* [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/), an open-source vector search engine\n* [Faiss](https://engineering.fb.com/2017/03/29/data-infrastructure/faiss-a-library-for-efficient-similarity-search/), a vector search algorithm by Facebook\n\nWhich distance function should I use?\n=====================================\n\n\nWe recommend [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). The choice of distance function typically doesn\u2019t matter much.\n\n\n\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\n\n\n* Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\n* Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings\n", "title": "Embeddings - Frequently Asked Questions", "article_id": "6824809", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6824809-embeddings-frequently-asked-questions"}

Here's what's new:\n\n\n* We\u2019ve updated performance of the ChatGPT model on our free plan in order to serve more users.\n* Based on user feedback, we are now defaulting Plus users to a faster version of ChatGPT, formerly known as \u201cTurbo\u201d. We\u2019ll keep the previous version around for a while.\n* We rolled out the ability to purchase [ChatGPT Plus](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plus/) internationally.\n\n\nIntroducing ChatGPT Plus (Feb 9 2023)\n-------------------------------------\n\n\nAs we recently announced, our Plus plan comes with early access to new, experimental features. We are beginning to roll out a way for Plus users the ability to choose between different versions of ChatGPT: \n\n\n* Default: the standard ChatGPT model\n* Turbo: optimized for speed (alpha)\n\nVersion selection is made easy with a dedicated dropdown menu at the top of the page. Depending on feedback, we may roll out this feature (or just Turbo) to all users soon.\n\n\n\nFactuality and mathematical improvements (Jan 30, 2023)\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe\u2019ve upgraded the ChatGPT model with improved factuality and mathematical capabilities.\n\n\n\nUpdates to ChatGPT (Jan 9, 2023)\n--------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. We made more improvements to the ChatGPT model! It should be generally better across a wide range of topics and has improved factuality.\n2. Stop generating: Based on your feedback, we've added the ability to stop generating ChatGPT's response\n\n\nPerformance updates to ChatGPT (Dec 15, 2022)\n---------------------------------------------\n\n\nWe're excited to announce several updates to ChatGPT! Here's what's new:\n\n\n1. General performance: Among other improvements, users will notice that ChatGPT is now less likely to refuse to answer questions.\n2. Conversation history: You\u2019ll soon be able to view past conversations with ChatGPT, rename your saved conversations and delete the ones you don\u2019t want to keep. We are gradually rolling out this feature.\n3. Daily limit: To ensure a high-quality experience for all ChatGPT users, we are experimenting with a daily message cap. If you\u2019re included in this group, you\u2019ll be presented with an option to extend your access by providing feedback to ChatGPT.\n\nTo see if you\u2019re using the updated version, look for \u201cChatGPT Dec 15 Version\u201d at the bottom of the screen.\n\n",

{"text": "When you get the error message:\n\n\n\n\n```\nIncorrect API key provided: API_KEY*********************************ZXY. You can find your API key at https://beta.openai.com\n```\n\n\nHere are a few simple steps you can take to resolve this issue.\n\n\n\nStep 1: Clear your browser's cache\n\n\nThe first step is to clear your browser's cache. Sometimes, your browser may hold onto an outdated version of your API key, which can cause this error message to appear. To clear your browser's cache, follow the instructions for your specific browser:\n\n\n* For Google Chrome, click on the three dots in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"History.\" Then, click on \"Clear browsing data\" and select \"Cookies and other site data\" and \"Cached images and files.\"\n* For Firefox, click on the three lines in the top-right corner of the browser and select \"Options.\" Then, click on \"Privacy & Security\" and scroll down to \"Cookies and Site Data.\" Click on \"Clear Data\" and select \"Cookies and Site Data\" and \"Cached Web Content.\"\n* For Safari, click on \"Safari\" in the top menu bar and select \"Preferences.\" Then, click on the \"Privacy\" tab and click on \"Manage Website Data.\" Select \"Remove All\" to clear your browser's cache.\n\nStep 2: Retry your request\n\n\nAfter clearing your browser's cache, try your request again. If the error message still appears, then move to the next step.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Check your API key\n\n\nCheck your API key at **[https://beta.openai.com](https://beta.openai.com/)** and verify it with the API key shown in the error message. Sometimes, the error message may include an old or incorrect API key that you no longer use. Double-check that you are using the correct API key for the request you're making.\n\n\n\nStep 4: Verify that you're not using two different API keys\n\n\nAnother possibility is that you may have accidentally used two different API keys. Make sure that you are using the same API key throughout your application or script and not switching between different keys.\n\n\n\nIf you still need help please reach out to our support team, and they will assist you with resolving the issue.\n\n\n  \n\u200b\n\n\n\n", "title": "Incorrect API key provided", "article_id": "6882433", "url": "https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6882433-incorrect-api-key-provided"}

{"text": "Every organization is bound by rate limits which determine how many requests can be sent per second. This rate limit has been hit by the request.\n\n\n\nRate limits can be quantized, meaning they are enforced over shorter periods of time (e.g. 60,000 requests/minute may be enforced as 1,000 requests/second). Sending short bursts of requests or contexts (prompts+max\\_tokens) that are too long can lead to rate limit errors, even when you are technically below the rate limit per minute.\n\n\n\n**How can I fix it?**\n\n\n* Include [exponential back-off](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/How_to_handle_rate_limits.ipynb) logic in your code. This will catch and retry failed requests.\n* For token limits\n\n\n\t+ Reduce the [max\\_tokens](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create#completions/create-max_tokens) to match the size of your completions. Usage needs are estimated from this value, so reducing it will decrease the chance that you unexpectedly receive a rate limit error. For example, if your prompt creates completions around 400 tokens, the max\\_tokens value should be around the same size.\n\t+ [Optimize your prompts](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/tree/main#more-prompt-advice). You can do this by making your instructions shorter, removing extra words, and getting rid of extra examples. You might need to work on your prompt and test it after these changes to make sure it still works well. The added benefit of a shorter prompt is reduced cost to you. If you need help, let us know.\n* If none of the previous steps work and you are consistently hitting a Rate Limit Error, you can increase your rate limits by [increasing your usage tier](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers).

# Triage agent

This example is a Swarm containing a triage agent, which takes in user inputs and chooses whether to respond directly, or triage the request
to a sales or refunds agent.

## Setup

To run the triage agent Swarm:

1. Run

```shell
python3 run.py
```

## Evals

> [!NOTE]
> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.

This example uses `Pytest` to run eval unit tests. We have two tests in the `evals.py` file, one which
tests if we call the correct triage function when expected, and one which assesses if a conversation
is 'successful', as defined in our prompt in `evals.py`.

To run the evals, run

```shell
pytest evals.py
```

# Weather agent

This example is a weather agent demonstrating function calling with a single agent. The agent has tools to get the weather of a particular city, and send an email.

## Setup

To run the weather agent Swarm:

1. Run

```shell
python3 run.py
```

## Evals

> [!NOTE]
> These evals are intended to be examples to demonstrate functionality, but will have to be updated and catered to your particular use case.

This example uses `Pytest` to run eval unit tests. We have two tests in the `evals.py` file, one which
tests if we call the `get_weather` function when expected, and one which assesses if we properly do NOT call the
`get_weather` function when we shouldn't have a tool call.

To run the evals, run

```shell

## Overview

At a high level, Devika consists of the following key components:

- **Agent Core**: Orchestrates the overall AI planning, reasoning and execution process. Communicates with various sub-agents.
- **Agents**: Specialized sub-agents that handle specific tasks like planning, research, coding, patching, reporting etc.  
- **Language Models**: Leverages large language models (LLMs) like Claude, GPT-4, GPT-3 for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Browser Interaction**: Enables web browsing, information gathering, and interaction with web elements.
- **Project Management**: Handles organization and persistence of project-related data. 
- **Agent State Management**: Tracks and persists the dynamic state of the AI agent across interactions.
- **Services**: Integrations with external services like GitHub, Netlify for enhanced capabilities.
- **Utilities**: Supporting modules for configuration, logging, vector search, PDF generation etc.

Let's dive into each of these components in more detail.

## Agent Core

The `Agent` class serves as the central engine that drives Devika's AI planning and execution loop. Here's how it works:

1. When a user provides a high-level prompt, the `execute` method is invoked on the Agent. 
2. The prompt is first passed to the Planner agent to generate a step-by-step plan.
3. The Researcher agent then takes this plan and extracts relevant search queries and context.
4. The Agent performs web searches using Bing Search API and crawls the top results. 
5. The raw crawled content is passed through the Formatter agent to extract clean, relevant information.
6. This researched context, along with the step-by-step plan, is fed to the Coder agent to generate code.
7. The generated code is saved to the project directory on disk.
8. If the user interacts further with a follow-up prompt, the `subsequent_execute` method is invoked.
9. The Action agent determines the appropriate action to take based on the user's message (run code, deploy, write tests, add feature, fix bug, write report etc.)
10. The corresponding specialized agent is invoked to perform the action (Runner, Feature, Patcher, Reporter).
11. Results are communicated back to the user and the project files are updated.

Throughout this process, the Agent Core is responsible for:
- Managing conversation history and project-specific context
- Updating agent state and internal monologue 
- Accumulating context keywords across agent prompts
- Emulating the "thinking" process of the AI through timed agent state updates
- Handling special commands through the Decision agent (e.g. git clone, browser interaction session)

## Agents

Devika's cognitive abilities are powered by a collection of specialized sub-agents. Each agent is implemented as a separate Python class. Agents communicate with the underlying LLMs through prompt templates defined in Jinja2 format. Key agents include:

### Planner
- Generates a high-level step-by-step plan based on the user's prompt
- Extracts focus area and provides a summary
- Uses few-shot prompting to provide examples of the expected response format

### Researcher
- Takes the generated plan and extracts relevant search queries 
- Ranks and filters queries based on relevance and specificity
- Prompts the user for additional context if required
- Aims to maximize information gain while minimizing number of searches

### Coder
- Generates code based on the step-by-step plan and researched context
- Segments code into appropriate files and directories
- Includes informative comments and documentation
- Handles a variety of languages and frameworks
- Validates code syntax and style

### Action
- Determines the appropriate action to take based on the user's follow-up prompt
- Maps user intent to a specific action keyword (run, test, deploy, fix, implement, report)
- Provides a human-like confirmation of the action to the user

### Runner
- Executes the written code in a sandboxed environment 
- Handles different OS environments (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- Streams command output to user in real-time
- Gracefully handles errors and exceptions

### Feature
- Implements a new feature based on user's specification
- Modifies existing project files while maintaining code structure and style
- Performs incremental testing to verify feature is working as expected

### Patcher
- Debugs and fixes issues based on user's description or error message
- Analyzes existing code to identify potential root causes
- Suggests and implements fix, with explanation of the changes made

### Reporter
- Generates a comprehensive report summarizing the project
- Includes high-level overview, technical design, setup instructions, API docs etc.
- Formats report in a clean, readable structure with table of contents
- Exports report as a PDF document

### Decision
- Handles special command-like instructions that don't fit other agents
- Maps commands to specific functions (git clone, browser interaction etc.)
- Executes the corresponding function with provided arguments

Each agent follows a common pattern:
1. Prepare a prompt by rendering the Jinja2 template with current context
2. Query the LLM to get a response based on the prompt
3. Validate and parse the LLM's response to extract structured output
4. Perform any additional processing or side-effects (e.g. save to disk)
5. Return the result to the Agent Core for further action

Agents aim to be stateless and idempotent where possible. State and history is managed by the Agent Core and passed into the agents as needed. This allows for a modular, composable design.

## Language Models

Devika's natural language processing capabilities are driven by state-of-the-art LLMs. The `LLM` class provides a unified interface to interact with different language models:

- **Claude** (Anthropic): Claude models like claude-v1.3, claude-instant-v1.0 etc.
- **GPT-4/GPT-3** (OpenAI): Models like gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo etc.
- **Self-hosted models** (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)): Allows using open-source models in a self-hosted environment

The `LLM` class abstracts out the specifics of each provider's API, allowing agents to interact with the models in a consistent way. It supports:
- Listing available models
- Generating completions based on a prompt
- Tracking and accumulating token usage over time

Choosing the right model for a given use case depends on factors like desired quality, speed, cost etc. The modular design allows swapping out models easily.

## Browser Interaction

Devika can interact with webpages in an automated fashion to gather information and perform actions. This is powered by the `Browser` and `Crawler` classes.

The `Browser` class uses Playwright to provide high-level web automation primitives:
- Spawning a browser instance (Chromium)
- Navigating to a URL
- Querying DOM elements 
- Extracting page content as text, Markdown, PDF etc.
- Taking a screenshot of the page

The `Crawler` class defines an agent that can interact with a webpage based on natural language instructions. It leverages:
- Pre-defined browser actions like scroll, click, type etc.
- A prompt template that provides examples of how to use these actions
- LLM to determine the best action to take based on current page content and objective

The `start_interaction` function sets up a loop where:
1. The current page content and objective is passed to the LLM 
2. The LLM returns the next best action to take (e.g. "CLICK 12" or "TYPE 7 machine learning")
3. The Crawler executes this action on the live page
4. The process repeats from the updated page state

This allows performing a sequence of actions to achieve a higher-level objective (e.g. research a topic, fill out a form, interact with an app etc.)

## Project Management

The `ProjectManager` class is responsible for creating, updating and querying projects and their associated metadata. Key functions include:

- Creating a new project and initializing its directory structure
- Deleting a project and its associated files
- Adding a message to a project's conversation history
- Retrieving messages for a given project
- Getting the latest user/AI message in a conversation
- Listing all projects
- Zipping a project's files for export

Project metadata is persisted in a SQLite database using SQLModel. The `Projects` table stores:
- Project name
- JSON-serialized conversation history

This allows the agent to work on multiple projects simultaneously and retain conversation history across sessions.

## Agent State Management

As the AI agent works on a task, we need to track and display its internal state to the user. The `AgentState` class handles this by providing an interface to:

- Initialize a new agent state 
- Add a state to the current sequence of states for a project
- Update the latest state for a project
- Query the latest state or entire state history for a project
- Mark the agent as active/inactive or task as completed

Agent state includes information like:
- Current step or action being executed
- Internal monologue reflecting the agent's current "thoughts"
- Browser interactions (URL visited, screenshot)
- Terminal interactions (command executed, output)
- Token usage so far

Like projects, agent states are also persisted in the SQLite DB using SQLModel. The `AgentStateModel` table stores:
- Project name
- JSON-serialized list of states

Having a persistent log of agent states is useful for:
- Providing real-time visibility to the user
- Auditing and debugging agent behavior
- Resuming from interruptions or failures

## Services

Devika integrates with external services to augment its capabilities:

- **GitHub**: Performing git operations like clone/pull, listing repos/commits/files etc.
- **Netlify**: Deploying web apps and sites seamlessly

The `GitHub` and `Netlify` classes provide lightweight wrappers around the respective service APIs. 
They handle authentication, making HTTP requests, and parsing responses.

This allows Devika to perform actions like:
- Cloning a repo given a GitHub URL
- Listing a user's GitHub repos 
- Creating a new Netlify site
- Deploying a directory to Netlify 
- Providing the deployed site URL to the user

Integrations are done in a modular way so that new services can be added easily.

## Utilities  

Devika makes use of several utility modules to support its functioning:

- `Config`: Loads and provides access to configuration settings (API keys, folder paths etc.) 
- `Logger`: Sets up logging to console and file, with support for log levels and colors
- `ReadCode`: Recursively reads code files in a directory and converts them into a Markdown format
- `SentenceBERT`: Extracts keywords and semantic information from text using SentenceBERT embeddings
- `Experts`: A collection of domain-specific knowledge bases to assist in certain areas (e.g. webdev, physics, chemistry, math)

The utility modules aim to provide reusable functionality that is used across different parts of the system.

## Conclusion

Devika is a complex system that combines multiple AI and automation techniques to deliver an intelligent programming assistant. Key design principles include:

- Modularity: Breaking down functionality into specialized agents and services
- Flexibility: Supporting different LLMs, services and domains in a pluggable fashion  
- Persistence: Storing project and agent state in a DB to enable pause/resume and auditing
- Transparency: Surfacing agent thought process and interactions to user in real-time

By understanding how the different components work together, we can extend, optimize and scale Devika to take on increasingly sophisticated software engineering tasks. The agent-based architecture provides a strong foundation to build more advanced AI capabilities in the future.

## Overview

At a high level, Devika consists of the following key components:

- **Agent Core**: Orchestrates the overall AI planning, reasoning and execution process. Communicates with various sub-agents.
- **Agents**: Specialized sub-agents that handle specific tasks like planning, research, coding, patching, reporting etc.  
- **Language Models**: Leverages large language models (LLMs) like Claude, GPT-4, GPT-3 for natural language understanding and generation.
- **Browser Interaction**: Enables web browsing, information gathering, and interaction with web elements.
- **Project Management**: Handles organization and persistence of project-related data. 
- **Agent State Management**: Tracks and persists the dynamic state of the AI agent across interactions.
- **Services**: Integrations with external services like GitHub, Netlify for enhanced capabilities.
- **Utilities**: Supporting modules for configuration, logging, vector search, PDF generation etc.

Let's dive into each of these components in more detail.

## Agent Core

The `Agent` class serves as the central engine that drives Devika's AI planning and execution loop. Here's how it works:

1. When a user provides a high-level prompt, the `execute` method is invoked on the Agent. 
2. The prompt is first passed to the Planner agent to generate a step-by-step plan.
3. The Researcher agent then takes this plan and extracts relevant search queries and context.
4. The Agent performs web searches using Bing Search API and crawls the top results. 
5. The raw crawled content is passed through the Formatter agent to extract clean, relevant information.
6. This researched context, along with the step-by-step plan, is fed to the Coder agent to generate code.
7. The generated code is saved to the project directory on disk.
8. If the user interacts further with a follow-up prompt, the `subsequent_execute` method is invoked.
9. The Action agent determines the appropriate action to take based on the user's message (run code, deploy, write tests, add feature, fix bug, write report etc.)
10. The corresponding specialized agent is invoked to perform the action (Runner, Feature, Patcher, Reporter).
11. Results are communicated back to the user and the project files are updated.

Throughout this process, the Agent Core is responsible for:
- Managing conversation history and project-specific context
- Updating agent state and internal monologue 
- Accumulating context keywords across agent prompts
- Emulating the "thinking" process of the AI through timed agent state updates
- Handling special commands through the Decision agent (e.g. git clone, browser interaction session)

## Agents

Devika's cognitive abilities are powered by a collection of specialized sub-agents. Each agent is implemented as a separate Python class. Agents communicate with the underlying LLMs through prompt templates defined in Jinja2 format. Key agents include:

### Planner
- Generates a high-level step-by-step plan based on the user's prompt
- Extracts focus area and provides a summary
- Uses few-shot prompting to provide examples of the expected response format

### Researcher
- Takes the generated plan and extracts relevant search queries 
- Ranks and filters queries based on relevance and specificity
- Prompts the user for additional context if required
- Aims to maximize information gain while minimizing number of searches

### Coder
- Generates code based on the step-by-step plan and researched context
- Segments code into appropriate files and directories
- Includes informative comments and documentation
- Handles a variety of languages and frameworks
- Validates code syntax and style

### Action
- Determines the appropriate action to take based on the user's follow-up prompt
- Maps user intent to a specific action keyword (run, test, deploy, fix, implement, report)
- Provides a human-like confirmation of the action to the user

### Runner
- Executes the written code in a sandboxed environment 
- Handles different OS environments (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- Streams command output to user in real-time
- Gracefully handles errors and exceptions

### Feature
- Implements a new feature based on user's specification
- Modifies existing project files while maintaining code structure and style
- Performs incremental testing to verify feature is working as expected

### Patcher
- Debugs and fixes issues based on user's description or error message
- Analyzes existing code to identify potential root causes
- Suggests and implements fix, with explanation of the changes made

### Reporter
- Generates a comprehensive report summarizing the project
- Includes high-level overview, technical design, setup instructions, API docs etc.
- Formats report in a clean, readable structure with table of contents
- Exports report as a PDF document

### Decision
- Handles special command-like instructions that don't fit other agents
- Maps commands to specific functions (git clone, browser interaction etc.)
- Executes the corresponding function with provided arguments

Each agent follows a common pattern:
1. Prepare a prompt by rendering the Jinja2 template with current context
2. Query the LLM to get a response based on the prompt
3. Validate and parse the LLM's response to extract structured output
4. Perform any additional processing or side-effects (e.g. save to disk)
5. Return the result to the Agent Core for further action

Agents aim to be stateless and idempotent where possible. State and history is managed by the Agent Core and passed into the agents as needed. This allows for a modular, composable design.

## Language Models

Devika's natural language processing capabilities are driven by state-of-the-art LLMs. The `LLM` class provides a unified interface to interact with different language models:

- **Claude** (Anthropic): Claude models like claude-v1.3, claude-instant-v1.0 etc.
- **GPT-4/GPT-3** (OpenAI): Models like gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo etc.
- **Self-hosted models** (via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)): Allows using open-source models in a self-hosted environment

The `LLM` class abstracts out the specifics of each provider's API, allowing agents to interact with the models in a consistent way. It supports:
- Listing available models
- Generating completions based on a prompt
- Tracking and accumulating token usage over time

Choosing the right model for a given use case depends on factors like desired quality, speed, cost etc. The modular design allows swapping out models easily.

## Browser Interaction

Devika can interact with webpages in an automated fashion to gather information and perform actions. This is powered by the `Browser` and `Crawler` classes.

The `Browser` class uses Playwright to provide high-level web automation primitives:
- Spawning a browser instance (Chromium)
- Navigating to a URL
- Querying DOM elements 
- Extracting page content as text, Markdown, PDF etc.
- Taking a screenshot of the page

The `Crawler` class defines an agent that can interact with a webpage based on natural language instructions. It leverages:
- Pre-defined browser actions like scroll, click, type etc.
- A prompt template that provides examples of how to use these actions
- LLM to determine the best action to take based on current page content and objective

The `start_interaction` function sets up a loop where:
1. The current page content and objective is passed to the LLM 
2. The LLM returns the next best action to take (e.g. "CLICK 12" or "TYPE 7 machine learning")
3. The Crawler executes this action on the live page
4. The process repeats from the updated page state

This allows performing a sequence of actions to achieve a higher-level objective (e.g. research a topic, fill out a form, interact with an app etc.)

## Project Management

The `ProjectManager` class is responsible for creating, updating and querying projects and their associated metadata. Key functions include:

- Creating a new project and initializing its directory structure
- Deleting a project and its associated files
- Adding a message to a project's conversation history
- Retrieving messages for a given project
- Getting the latest user/AI message in a conversation
- Listing all projects
- Zipping a project's files for export

Project metadata is persisted in a SQLite database using SQLModel. The `Projects` table stores:
- Project name
- JSON-serialized conversation history

This allows the agent to work on multiple projects simultaneously and retain conversation history across sessions.

## Agent State Management

As the AI agent works on a task, we need to track and display its internal state to the user. The `AgentState` class handles this by providing an interface to:

- Initialize a new agent state 
- Add a state to the current sequence of states for a project
- Update the latest state for a project
- Query the latest state or entire state history for a project
- Mark the agent as active/inactive or task as completed

Agent state includes information like:
- Current step or action being executed
- Internal monologue reflecting the agent's current "thoughts"
- Browser interactions (URL visited, screenshot)
- Terminal interactions (command executed, output)
- Token usage so far

Like projects, agent states are also persisted in the SQLite DB using SQLModel. The `AgentStateModel` table stores:
- Project name
- JSON-serialized list of states

Having a persistent log of agent states is useful for:
- Providing real-time visibility to the user
- Auditing and debugging agent behavior
- Resuming from interruptions or failures

## Services

Devika integrates with external services to augment its capabilities:

- **GitHub**: Performing git operations like clone/pull, listing repos/commits/files etc.
- **Netlify**: Deploying web apps and sites seamlessly

The `GitHub` and `Netlify` classes provide lightweight wrappers around the respective service APIs. 
They handle authentication, making HTTP requests, and parsing responses.

This allows Devika to perform actions like:
- Cloning a repo given a GitHub URL
- Listing a user's GitHub repos 
- Creating a new Netlify site
- Deploying a directory to Netlify 
- Providing the deployed site URL to the user

Integrations are done in a modular way so that new services can be added easily.

## Utilities  

Devika makes use of several utility modules to support its functioning:

- `Config`: Loads and provides access to configuration settings (API keys, folder paths etc.) 
- `Logger`: Sets up logging to console and file, with support for log levels and colors
- `ReadCode`: Recursively reads code files in a directory and converts them into a Markdown format
- `SentenceBERT`: Extracts keywords and semantic information from text using SentenceBERT embeddings
- `Experts`: A collection of domain-specific knowledge bases to assist in certain areas (e.g. webdev, physics, chemistry, math)

The utility modules aim to provide reusable functionality that is used across different parts of the system.

## Conclusion

Devika is a complex system that combines multiple AI and automation techniques to deliver an intelligent programming assistant. Key design principles include:

- Modularity: Breaking down functionality into specialized agents and services
- Flexibility: Supporting different LLMs, services and domains in a pluggable fashion  
- Persistence: Storing project and agent state in a DB to enable pause/resume and auditing
- Transparency: Surfacing agent thought process and interactions to user in real-time

By understanding how the different components work together, we can extend, optimize and scale Devika to take on increasingly sophisticated software engineering tasks. The agent-based architecture provides a strong foundation to build more advanced AI capabilities in the future.

================================================
## Under The Hood

Let's dive deeper into some of the key components and techniques used in Devika:

### AI Planning and Reasoning

Devika employs advanced AI planning and reasoning algorithms to break down high-level objectives into actionable steps. The planning process involves the following stages:

1. **Objective Understanding**: Devika analyzes the given objective or task description to understand the user's intent and requirements.
2. **Context Gathering**: Relevant context is collected from the conversation history, project files, and knowledge base to inform the planning process.
3. **Step Generation**: Based on the objective and context, Devika generates a sequence of high-level steps to accomplish the task.
4. **Refinement and Validation**: The generated steps are refined and validated to ensure their feasibility and alignment with the objective.
5. **Execution**: Devika executes each step in the plan, utilizing various sub-agents and modules as needed.

The reasoning engine constantly evaluates the progress and makes adjustments to the plan based on new information or feedback received during execution.

### Keyword Extraction

To enable focused research and information gathering, Devika employs keyword extraction techniques. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing**: The input text (objective, conversation history, or project files) is preprocessed by removing stop words, tokenizing, and normalizing the text.
2. **Keyword Identification**: Devika uses the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to identify important keywords and phrases from the preprocessed text. BERT's pre-training on a large corpus allows it to capture semantic relationships and understand the significance of words in the given context.
3. **Keyword Ranking**: The identified keywords are ranked based on their relevance and importance to the task at hand. Techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and TextRank are used to assign scores to each keyword.
4. **Keyword Selection**: The top-ranked keywords are selected as the most relevant and informative for the current context. These keywords are used to guide the research and information gathering process.

By extracting contextually relevant keywords, Devika can focus its research efforts and retrieve pertinent information to assist in the task completion.

### Browser Interaction

Devika incorporates browser interaction capabilities to navigate websites, extract information, and interact with web elements. The browser interaction module leverages the Playwright library to automate web interactions. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Navigation**: Devika uses Playwright to navigate to specific URLs or perform searches based on the keywords or requirements provided.
2. **Element Interaction**: Playwright allows Devika to interact with web elements such as clicking buttons, filling forms, and extracting text from specific elements.
3. **Page Parsing**: Devika parses the HTML structure of the web pages visited to extract relevant information. It uses techniques like CSS selectors and XPath to locate and extract specific data points.
4. **JavaScript Execution**: Playwright enables Devika to execute JavaScript code within the browser context, allowing for dynamic interactions and data retrieval.
5. **Screenshot Capture**: Devika can capture screenshots of the web pages visited, which can be useful for visual reference or debugging purposes.

The browser interaction module empowers Devika to gather information from the web, interact with online resources, and incorporate real-time data into its decision-making and code generation processes.

### Code Writing

Devika's code writing module generates code based on the plan, research findings, and user requirements. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Language Selection**: Devika identifies the programming language specified by the user or infers it based on the project context.
2. **Code Structure Generation**: Based on the plan and language-specific patterns, Devika generates the high-level structure of the code, including classes, functions, and modules.
3. **Code Population**: Devika fills in the code structure with specific logic, algorithms, and data manipulation statements. It leverages the research findings, code snippets from the knowledge base, and its own understanding of programming concepts to generate meaningful code.
4. **Code Formatting**: The generated code is formatted according to the language-specific conventions and best practices to ensure readability and maintainability.
5. **Code Review and Refinement**: Devika reviews the generated code for syntax errors, logical inconsistencies, and potential improvements. It iteratively refines the code based on its own analysis and any feedback provided by the user.

Devika's code writing capabilities enable it to generate functional and efficient code in various programming languages, taking into account the specific requirements and context of each project.

You are Devika, an AI Software Engineer. You have been talking to the user and this is your exchanges so far:

```
{% for message in conversation %}
{{ message }}
{% endfor %}
```

User's last message: {{ conversation[-1] }}

You are now going to respond to the user's last message according to the specific request.

The user could be asking the following:
- `answer` - Answer a question about the project.
- `run` - Run the project.
- `deploy` - Deploy the project.
- `feature` - Add a new feature to the project.
- `bug` - Fix a bug in the project.
- `report` - Generate a report on the project.

Your response should be in the following format:
```
{
    "response": "Your human-like response to the user's message here describing the action you are taking."
    "action": "run"
}
```

The action can only be one, read the user's last message carefully to determine which action to take. Sometimes the user's prompt might indicate multiple actions but you should only take one optimal action and use your answer response to convey what you are doing.

Any response other than the JSON format will be rejected by the system.

You are Devika, an AI Software Engineer. You have been talking to the user and this is your exchange so far:

```
{% for message in conversation %}
{{ message }}
{% endfor %}
```

Full Code:
~~~
{{ code_markdown }}
~~~

User's last message: {{ conversation[-1] }}

Your response should be in the following format:
```
{
    "response": "Your human-like response to the user's last message."
}
```

Rules:
- Read the full context, including the code (if any) carefully to answer the user's prompt.
- Your response can be as long as possible, but it should be concise and to the point.

Any response other than the JSON format will be rejected by the system.

Project Step-by-step Plan:
```
{{ step_by_step_plan }}
```

Context From User:
```
{{ user_context }}
```

Context From Knowledge Base:

{% if not knowledge_base_context %}
No context found.
{% else %}
{% for query, result in search_results.items() %}
Query: {{ query }}
Result:
```
{{ result }}
```
---
{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

Read the step-by-step plan carefully. Think step-by-step. Learn relevant information from the knowledge base context. Then write the code to implement the step-by-step plan.

Your response should only be in the following Markdown format:

~~~
File: `main.py`:
```py
print("Example")
```

File: `src/main.rs`:
```rs
fn main() {
    println!("Example");
}
```

File: `nested/directory/example/code.py`:
```py
print("Example")
```

File: `README.md`
```md
# Example

This is an example.
```
~~~

Rules:
- You should write clean and documented code.
- The code should work on the first try without any errors or bugs.
- Choose the library or dependency you know best.
- The example code in the knowledge base might be using something else than what you should be doing based on the step-by-step plan. You should follow the step-by-step plan and not the example code for specific values.
- The extension used for the Markdown code blocks should be accurate.
- Nested directories should be specified in the Markdown filename, the code structure should be accurate. If it requires to be nested to work, then it should be nested.
- You need to include required files for the code to run. Like: requirements.txt, Cargo.toml, etc.
- Files like Cargo.toml are mandatory to be included, the project won't work without it.

Any response other than this format will be rejected. You should not refuse to complete the task, you should try your absolute best and if there's any implementation detail that's impossible to complete, you should write a comment in the code explaining why it's impossible to complete. The refusal is only a last resort, it should never happen.

Your response should start with "~~~" and end with "~~~" just like the example format provided. Never provide any explanation or context inside the response, only the filenames and the code in the format provided. Do not leave any "Note".

You are Devika, an AI software engineer. You are given the following prompt from the user:

```
{{ prompt }}
```

From this prompt, you have to chain function calls from the following options that can accomplish the user's request in the most optimal way.

JSON Functions:

## `git_clone`:
Description: The user's request includes a GitHub URL, and you have to clone the repository to the user's local machine.
Usage:
```
{
    "function": "git_clone",
    "args": {
        "url": "<GitHub URL from the user>"
    },
    "reply": "<Inform the user what you're doing here in a human-like response>"
}
```

## `generate_pdf_document`:
Description: The user's request is to create a document for the following: Report, Documentation, Project Technical Document, Workshop Material, Homework, Assignment, or any other document.
Usage:
```
{
    "function": "generate_pdf_document",
    "args": {
        "user_prompt": "<Write the user's prompt but even more verbose and detailed>"
    },
    "reply": "<Inform the user what you're doing here in a human-like response>"
}
```

## `browser_interaction`:
Description: The user's request is to interact with a website. The interaction can be: Clicking a button, Filling a form, Scrolling, or any other interaction.
The user might be asking you to post something on Twitter or Reddit or even searching something on Google.
Usage:
```
{
    "function": "browser_interaction",
    "args": {
        "user_prompt": "<Write the user's prompt but even more verbose and detailed>"
    },
    "reply": "<Inform the user what you're doing here in a human-like response>"
}
```

User wants the following feature to be implemented: {{ conversation[-1] }}

System Operating System: {{ system_os }}

Read the user's feature request carefully. Think step-by-step.

Rules:
- You should write clean and documented code.
- The code should work on the first try without any errors or bugs.
- Choose the library or dependency you know best.
- The extension used for the Markdown code blocks should be accurate.
- You should respond with the complete rewritten code with no implementation detail left. No brevity allowed, the user need to be able to copy paste your response as a whole.

Your response should only be in the following Markdown format:

~~~
File: `main.py`:
```py

You are provided with a raw extracted text from a PDF render of a web page. This web page could be a blog, documentation, or any other type of web page.

Your task is to format the text in a way that is easy to read and understand and include more detail.

You are essentially a RAW text to clean Markdown convertor. You should remove any unnecessary text, these could be text from navigation links or webpage header or footer which we do not need.

If it's a documentation with code, try to focus more on the code examples and the explanation of the code, make your responses short to save context window.

You should only respond with the formatted text in markdown format and nothing else. Start your response with "```" and end with "```".

You are Devika, an AI Software Engineer.

One of your AI agent module is currently working through the following prompt:

```
{{ current_prompt }}
```

To show the user what you're thinking about or doing, respond with a short human-like response verbalizing your internal monologue.

Your response should be in the following JSON format:

```
{
    "internal_monologue": "<YOUR INTERNAL MONOLOGUE>"
}
```

TIP: Make the internal monologue very human-like and conversational. It should be very short and concise.

Only the provided JSON response format is accepted. Any other response format will be rejected.

You are Devika, an AI Software Engineer. You have been talking to the user and this is the exchange so far:

```
{% for message in conversation %}
{{ message }}
{% endfor %}
```

Full Code:
~~~
{{ code_markdown }}
~~~

{% if commands %}
You tried to execute the following commands to run this project:
```
{% for command in commands %}
$ {{ command }}
{% endfor %}
```
{% endif %}

{% if error %}
But it resulted in the following error:
```
$ {{ commands[-1] }}
{{ error }}
```
{% endif %}

System Operating System: {{ system_os }}

Read the encountered bug carefully and reason with the code to identify the problem. Think step-by-step.

Rules:
- You should write clean and documented code.
- The code should work on the first try without any errors or bugs.
- Choose the library or dependency you know best.
- The extension used for the Markdown code blocks should be accurate.
- You should respond with the complete rewritten code with no implementation detail left. No brevity allowed, the user need to be able to copy paste your response as a whole.

Your response should only be in the following Markdown format:

~~~
File: `main.py`:
```py
print("Example")
```

File: `src/example.rs`:
```rs
fn example() {
    println!("Example");
}
```

File: `nested/directory/example/code.py`:
```py
print("Example")
```

File: `README.md`
```md
# Example

This is an example.
```
~~~

Any response other than this format will be rejected. You should not refuse to complete the task, you should try your absolute best and if there's any implementation detail that's impossible to complete, you should write a comment in the code explaining why it's impossible to complete. The refusal is only a last resort, it should never happen.

Your response should start with "~~~" and end with "~~~" just like the example format provided. Never provide any explanation or context inside the response, only the filenames and the code in the format provided. Do not leave any "Note".

You are Devika, an AI Software Engineer.

The user asked: {{ prompt }}

Based on the user's request, create a step-by-step plan to accomplish the task.

Follow this format for your response:

```
Project Name: <Write an apt project name with no longer than 5 words>

Your Reply to the Human Prompter: <short human-like response to the prompt stating how you are creating the plan, do not start with "As an AI".>

Current Focus: Briefly state the main objective or focus area for the plan.

Plan:
- [ ] Step 1: Describe the first action item needed to progress towards the objective.
- [ ] Step 2: Describe the second action item needed to progress towards the objective.
...
- [ ] Step N: Describe the final action item needed to complete the objective.

Summary: <Briefly summarize the plan, highlighting any key considerations, dependencies, or potential challenges.>
```

Each step should be a clear, concise description of a specific task or action required. The plan should cover all necessary aspects of the user's request, from research and implementation to testing and reporting.

Write the plan with knowing that you have access to the browser and search engine to accomplish the task.

After listing the steps, provide a brief summary of the plan, highlighting any key considerations, dependencies, or potential challenges.

Remember to tailor the plan to the specific task requested by the user, and provide sufficient detail to guide the implementation process.

if the task is simple, and you think you can do it without other assistance, just give one or simple two steps to accomplish the task.
don't need to overcomplicate if it's not necessary.

Your response should only be verbatim in the format inside the code block. Any other response format will be rejected.

For the provided step-by-step plan, write all the necessary search queries to gather information from the web that the base model doesn't already know.

Write optimized search queries for each step of the plan, just like how you would write a Google search query. Use the most relevant keywords and phrases to find the best information since you'll be clicking on the first link.

also only ask for information if you think it's necessary, otherwise leave ask_user field empty.

Step-by-Step Plan:
{{ step_by_step_plan }}

Only respond in the following JSON format:

```
{
    "queries": ["<QUERY 1>", "<QUERY 2>", "<QUERY 3>", ... ],
    "ask_user": "<ASK INPUT FROM USER IF REQUIRED, OTHERWISE LEAVE EMPTY STRING>"
}
```
Example =>
```
{
     "queries": ["How to do Bing Search via API in Python", "Claude API Documentation Python"],
     "ask_user": "Can you please provide API Keys for Claude, OpenAI, and Firebase?"
}
```

Keywords for Search Query: {{ contextual_keywords }}


Rules:
- Only search for a maximum of 3 queries.
- Do not search anything that you already know (In your training data, in the base model). For example: You already know how to write a Python flask web server, it is in your data, so you shouldn't search how to do that.
- Do not search for information that is not relevant to the task at hand.
- Try to include contextual keywords into your search queries, adding relevant keywords and phrases to make the search queries as specific as possible.
- Only search for documentation, do not search basic how tos. Forbidden Queries: How to install XYZ, How to setup ABC, etc.
- Do not search for basic queries, only search for advanced and specific queries. You are allowed to leave the "queries" field empty if no search queries are needed for the step.
- DO NOT EVER SEARCH FOR BASIC QUERIES. ONLY SEARCH FOR ADVANCED QUERIES.
- YOU ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE "queries" FIELD EMPTY IF NO SEARCH QUERIES ARE NEEDED FOR THE STEP.
- you only have to return one JSON object with the queries and ask_user fields. You can't return multiple JSON objects.

Only the provided JSON response format is accepted. Any other response format will be rejected.

Full Code:

User's last message: {{ conversation[-1] }}

System Operating System: {{ system_os }}

Your task is to invoke the system to run this code.

Your response should be in the following format:

Rules:
- You wrote the code, never address the user directly. You should not say things like "The code you provided", instead use "The code I wrote".
- Read the full context, including the code (if any) carefully to construct the commands required to run the project.
- The command should be compatible with the system operating system provided.
- You are inside the project directory, so just run the commands as if you're inside the project directory as the working directory.
- Do not do "cd" into the project directory. The system is already in the project directory.

Any response other than the JSON format will be rejected by the system.

Now identify whether this error is caused by the code or the command. If it is caused by the command, provide the correct command to run the project. If it is caused by the code, respond with the patch action response.

Patch Action Response:
```

  "action": "patch",
  "response": "<A response like: I encountered an error while running the project. Seems to be <problem>. Let me try fixing it.>"
}

You are an agent controlling a browser. You are given:

	(1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
	(2) the URL of your current web page
	(3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window (more on that below)

You can issue these commands:
	SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
	SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
	CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
	TYPE X "TEXT" - type the specified text into the input with id X
	TYPESUBMIT X "TEXT" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:

		<link id=1>text</link>
		<button id=2>text</button>
		<input id=3>text</input>

Images are rendered as their alt text like this:

		<img id=4 alt=""/>

Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command 
like "TYPESUBMIT 7 "search query"" to get to a more useful page.

Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command "CLICK 24" to click
on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
probably be a CLICK.)

Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

Here are some examples:

# Agent Prompts Configuration

# Browser Interaction Prompt
browser_interaction: |
  You are an agent controlling a browser. You are given:
  (1) an objective that you are trying to achieve
  (2) the URL of your current web page
  (3) a simplified text description of what's visible in the browser window

  You can issue these commands:
  SCROLL UP - scroll up one page
  SCROLL DOWN - scroll down one page
  CLICK X - click on a given element. You can only click on links, buttons, and inputs!
  TYPE X "TEXT" - type the specified text into the input with id X
  TYPESUBMIT X "TEXT" - same as TYPE above, except then it presses ENTER to submit the form

  The format of the browser content is highly simplified; all formatting elements are stripped.
  Interactive elements such as links, inputs, buttons are represented like this:
  <link id=1>text</link>
  <button id=2>text</button>
  <input id=3>text</input>

  Images are rendered as their alt text like this:
  <img id=4 alt=""/>

  Based on your given objective, issue whatever command you believe will get you closest to achieving your goal.
  You always start on Google; you should submit a search query to Google that will take you to the best page for
  achieving your objective. And then interact with that page to achieve your objective.

  If you find yourself on Google and there are no search results displayed yet, you should probably issue a command 
  like "TYPESUBMIT 7 "search query"" to get to a more useful page.

  Then, if you find yourself on a Google search results page, you might issue the command "CLICK 24" to click
  on the first link in the search results. (If your previous command was a TYPESUBMIT your next command should
  probably be a CLICK.)

  Don't try to interact with elements that you can't see.

# Planner Agent Prompt
planner: |
  You are a planning agent that breaks down complex tasks into clear, actionable steps.
  Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with EXACTLY this structure:
  {{
    "type": "code|research|answer|factual|analytical|how_to",

      {{
        "id": "step1",
        "agent": "researcher|coder|answer",
        "type": "factual|analytical|code_generation|data_retrieval|how_to|research|answer",
        "description": "What this step will do",
        "queries": ["specific query 1", "specific query 2"],
        "dependencies": ["step_id1", "step_id2"],

      "agent": "answer",
      "description": "What the final answer will provide",
      "required_components": ["component1", "component2"]
    }}
  }}

  STRICT VALIDATION RULES:
  1. JSON Format:
     - Response MUST be a valid JSON object
     - No text before or after the JSON
     - No markdown code blocks
     - No comments or explanations

  2. Task Type:
     - "type" field must be EXACTLY one of: "code", "research", "answer"
     - For code generation tasks, use "code"
     - For research tasks, use "research"
     - For answer tasks, use "answer"

  3. Agent Types:
     - ONLY use these exact agent types: "researcher", "coder", "answer"
     - "researcher" for gathering information
     - "coder" for implementing code
     - "answer" for final answers
     - The final_answer agent MUST be "answer"

  4. Step Structure:
     - Each step MUST have: id, agent, description, expected_output
     - Step IDs must be unique
     - Dependencies must reference valid step IDs
     - Queries must be specific and actionable

  5. Final Answer:
     - Must have agent="answer"
     - Must have description and required_components
     - Required components must be a list of strings

  Example response for a code generation task:
  {{

  Example response for a research task:
  {{
    "type": "research",
    "steps": [
      {{
        "id": "step1",
        "agent": "researcher",

.Synopsis
Activate a Python virtual environment for the current PowerShell session.

.Description
Pushes the python executable for a virtual environment to the front of the
$Env:PATH environment variable and sets the prompt to signify that you are
in a Python virtual environment. Makes use of the command line switches as
well as the `pyvenv.cfg` file values present in the virtual environment.

.Parameter VenvDir
Path to the directory that contains the virtual environment to activate. The
default value for this is the parent of the directory that the Activate.ps1
script is located within.

.Parameter Prompt
The prompt prefix to display when this virtual environment is activated. By
default, this prompt is the name of the virtual environment folder (VenvDir)
surrounded by parentheses and followed by a single space (ie. '(.venv) ').

.Example
Activate.ps1
Activates the Python virtual environment that contains the Activate.ps1 script.

.Example
Activate.ps1 -Verbose
Activates the Python virtual environment that contains the Activate.ps1 script,
and shows extra information about the activation as it executes.

.Example
Activate.ps1 -VenvDir C:\Users\MyUser\Common\.venv
Activates the Python virtual environment located in the specified location.

.Example
Activate.ps1 -Prompt "MyPython"
Activates the Python virtual environment that contains the Activate.ps1 script,
and prefixes the current prompt with the specified string (surrounded in
parentheses) while the virtual environment is active.

.Notes
On Windows, it may be required to enable this Activate.ps1 script by setting the
execution policy for the user. You can do this by issuing the following PowerShell
command:

PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

For more information on Execution Policies:

<# Function declarations --------------------------------------------------- #>

<#
.Synopsis
Remove all shell session elements added by the Activate script, including the
addition of the virtual environment's Python executable from the beginning of
the PATH variable.

.Parameter NonDestructive
If present, do not remove this function from the global namespace for the
session.

.Description
Get-PyVenvConfig parses the values from the pyvenv.cfg file located in the
given folder, and returns them in a map.

For each line in the pyvenv.cfg file, if that line can be parsed into exactly
two strings separated by `=` (with any amount of whitespace surrounding the =)
then it is considered a `key = value` line. The left hand string is the key,
the right hand is the value.

If the value starts with a `'` or a `"` then the first and last character is
stripped from the value before being captured.

.Parameter ConfigDir
Path to the directory that contains the `pyvenv.cfg` file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
isympy is a Python shell for SymPy. It is just a normal python shell
(ipython shell if you have the ipython package installed) that executes
the following commands so that you don't have to:
.PP
.nf
\*(T<
>>> from __future__ import division
>>> from sympy import *
>>> x, y, z = symbols("x,y,z")
>>> k, m, n = symbols("k,m,n", integer=True)
    \*(T>
.fi
.PP
So starting isympy is equivalent to starting python (or ipython) and
executing the above commands by hand. It is intended for easy and quick
experimentation with SymPy. For more complicated programs, it is recommended
to write a script and import things explicitly (using the "from sympy
import sin, log, Symbol, ..." idiom).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-c \fR\*(T>\fISHELL\fR, \*(T<\fB\-\-console=\fR\*(T>\fISHELL\fR
Use the specified shell (python or ipython) as
console backend instead of the default one (ipython
if present or python otherwise).

Example: isympy -c python

\fISHELL\fR could be either
\&'ipython' or 'python'
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-p \fR\*(T>\fIENCODING\fR, \*(T<\fB\-\-pretty=\fR\*(T>\fIENCODING\fR
Setup pretty printing in SymPy. By default, the most pretty, unicode
printing is enabled (if the terminal supports it). You can use less
pretty ASCII printing instead or no pretty printing at all.

Example: isympy -p no

\fIENCODING\fR must be one of 'unicode',
\&'ascii' or 'no'.
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-t \fR\*(T>\fITYPE\fR, \*(T<\fB\-\-types=\fR\*(T>\fITYPE\fR
Setup the ground types for the polys. By default, gmpy ground types
are used if gmpy2 or gmpy is installed, otherwise it falls back to python
ground types, which are a little bit slower. You can manually
choose python ground types even if gmpy is installed (e.g., for testing purposes).

Note that sympy ground types are not supported, and should be used
only for experimental purposes.

Note that the gmpy1 ground type is primarily intended for testing; it the
use of gmpy even if gmpy2 is available.

This is the same as setting the environment variable
SYMPY_GROUND_TYPES to the given ground type (e.g.,
SYMPY_GROUND_TYPES='gmpy')

The ground types can be determined interactively from the variable
sympy.polys.domains.GROUND_TYPES inside the isympy shell itself.

Example: isympy -t python

\fITYPE\fR must be one of 'gmpy',
\&'gmpy1' or 'python'.
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-o \fR\*(T>\fIORDER\fR, \*(T<\fB\-\-order=\fR\*(T>\fIORDER\fR
Setup the ordering of terms for printing. The default is lex, which
orders terms lexicographically (e.g., x**2 + x + 1). You can choose
other orderings, such as rev-lex, which will use reverse
lexicographic ordering (e.g., 1 + x + x**2).

Note that for very large expressions, ORDER='none' may speed up
printing considerably, with the tradeoff that the order of the terms
in the printed expression will have no canonical order

Example: isympy -o rev-lax

\fIORDER\fR must be one of 'lex', 'rev-lex', 'grlex',
\&'rev-grlex', 'grevlex', 'rev-grevlex', 'old', or 'none'.
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-q\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-quiet\fR\*(T>
Print only Python's and SymPy's versions to stdout at startup, and nothing else.
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-d\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-doctest\fR\*(T>
Use the same format that should be used for doctests. This is
equivalent to '\fIisympy -c python -p no\fR'.
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-C\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-no\-cache\fR\*(T>
Disable the caching mechanism. Disabling the cache may slow certain
operations down considerably. This is useful for testing the cache,
or for benchmarking, as the cache can result in deceptive benchmark timings.

This is the same as setting the environment variable SYMPY_USE_CACHE
to 'no'.
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-a\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-auto\fR\*(T>
Automatically create missing symbols. Normally, typing a name of a
Symbol that has not been instantiated first would raise NameError,
but with this option enabled, any undefined name will be
automatically created as a Symbol. This only works in IPython 0.11.

Note that this is intended only for interactive, calculator style
usage. In a script that uses SymPy, Symbols should be instantiated
at the top, so that it's clear what they are.

This will not override any names that are already defined, which
includes the single character letters represented by the mnemonic
QCOSINE (see the "Gotchas and Pitfalls" document in the
documentation). You can delete existing names by executing "del
name" in the shell itself. You can see if a name is defined by typing
"'name' in globals()".

The Symbols that are created using this have default assumptions.
If you want to place assumptions on symbols, you should create them
using symbols() or var().

Finally, this only works in the top level namespace. So, for
example, if you define a function in isympy with an undefined
Symbol, it will not work.
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-D\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-debug\fR\*(T>
Enable debugging output. This is the same as setting the
environment variable SYMPY_DEBUG to 'True'. The debug status is set
in the variable SYMPY_DEBUG within isympy.
.TP
-- \fIPYTHONOPTIONS\fR
These options will be passed on to \fIipython (1)\fR shell.
Only supported when ipython is being used (standard python shell not supported).

Two dashes (--) are required to separate \fIPYTHONOPTIONS\fR
from the other isympy options.

For example, to run iSymPy without startup banner and colors:

isympy -q -c ipython -- --colors=NoColor
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-h\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-help\fR\*(T>
Print help output and exit.
.TP
\*(T<\fB\-v\fR\*(T>, \*(T<\fB\-\-version\fR\*(T>
Print isympy version information and exit.
.SH FILES
.TP
\*(T<\fI${HOME}/.sympy\-history\fR\*(T>
Saves the history of commands when using the python
shell as backend.
.SH BUGS
